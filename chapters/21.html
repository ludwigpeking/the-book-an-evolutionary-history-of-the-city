<p>
  In this chapter we discuss the phenomenon of the suburbanization of cities.
</p>

<p>
  In the field of urban studies, suburbanization is a significant topic, and for
  good reason. If we look at today's cities, suburban areas have far exceeded
  the size of the urban core. Taking the United States as an example, more than
  half of the population resides in the suburbs, surpassing both urban and rural
  areas combined. So, today, it's more accurate to say that we live in a
  suburban era. But what exactly is suburbanization?
</p>

<p><strong>the Definition of Suburbanization</strong></p>

<p>
  Before the 19th century, cities were relatively small, typically with
  diameters of 1-2 kilometers. Even major capitals like Constantinople and Yuan
  Dynasty's Dadu (modern Beijing) had diameters of only 5-6 kilometers. The
  population and building density within the city were quite high, ranging from
  5,000 to 50,000 people per square kilometer. Beyond the city limits lay rural
  areas with very low population and building density, often more than ten times
  lower. Visually, these two areas were distinct and easily separated.
</p>

<p>
  However, in the 19th century and especially today, cities have grown
  significantly, often spanning 30-50 kilometers in diameter. Around the densely
  populated urban core, there are areas with intermediate density, falling
  somewhere between the urban core and the countryside. This is what we refer to
  as the suburbs. The term "suburb" comes from Latin, meaning "near the city" or
  "secondary urban area." Suburbanization is the rapid expansion of these
  secondary urban areas. To put it simply, there have been two major waves of
  transportation technology that have driven suburbanization.
</p>

<p><strong>Two Waves</strong></p>

<p>
  The first wave began in the 19th century with public transport systems like
  trams/trains. These became widespread in developed countries around 1900 and
  continue to evolve today in the form of subways, light rail, and other
  systems.
</p>

<p>
  The second wave, which came in the 20th century, brought the widespread
  adoption of automobiles and the construction of road networks. The peak of
  this adoption was after World War II, and it's still ongoing in developing
  countries today, meaning its peak is yet to come.
</p>

<p>
  The first wave, driven by trams and subways, led to suburbs with relatively
  higher population densities compared to the second wave, driven by
  automobiles. In fact, today, trains are not even considered a major factor in
  suburbanization by urban planning professionals. Instead, they are seen as
  factors in urban renaissance. Trams and subways are viewed positively by
  professionals, while the image of car-centric suburbanization is often seen as
  negative, especially in the context of carbon neutrality and carbon reduction
  efforts. Most experts do not consider widespread car adoption in the
  developing world as an environmentally viable option. However, we need to face
  a fact: the second wave, driven by cars, has had a far more significant impact
  on suburbanization. The expansion of city limits has emphasized the advantages
  of automobiles, intensified the market's reliance on cars, created a positive
  feedback loop, and exacerbated the situation. Furthermore, in the future, I
  believe that cars are unlikely to yield their share to public transport
  systems but will give way to shared car systems, especially autonomous vehicle
  systems. I discussed this issue in Episode 37 (Podcast&lt;陈腐粉碎机&gt;).

<p><strong>Revisit into the History</strong></p>

<p>
  We've previously discussed several concepts. Before the 19th century, most
  people traveled by foot, with an average speed of about 80 meters per minute.
  Traditional cities were built around this mode of transportation. Traditional
  cities generally fell into three size categories:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Small cities with diameters of 1-2 kilometers, housing a few thousand to
    tens of thousands of people. Most places in these cities were within a
    15-minute walk. Many ancient and medieval cities fit into this category.
  </li>

  <li>
    Larger cities with diameters of 2-3 kilometers, home to tens of thousands to
    over a hundred thousand people. Most places were within a half-hour walk.
    Examples include Uruk, Florence, and Venice.
  </li>

  <li>
    Imperial cities with diameters of around 5 kilometers or more. These large
    cities, which were not common before modern times, could have populations
    ranging from hundreds of thousands to over a million people. Most places
    were within an hour's walk. Examples include 4th-century Rome, 7th-century
    Chang'an, Constantinople, 18th-century Edo (modern Tokyo), 13th-century
    Hangzhou, and 14th-century Dadu (modern Beijing). Cities of this scale often
    had populations that far exceeded what the surrounding agricultural areas
    could provide for, relying on significant food imports and serving as
    central hubs for extensive regions.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  These were the traditional cities before suburbanization. Their boundaries
  were clear, with a clear distinction between the urban core and the
  countryside. Just beyond the city gates, there might be small commercial
  communities, followed by relatively homogeneous rural areas with a few villas,
  farms, and extensive fields, pastures, and forests. Wealthy individuals could
  afford suburban villas. For example, Louis XIV regularly resided in the Palace
  of Versailles in the suburbs of Paris, essentially his villa, but he rarely
  visited the city itself. Nobles living in the suburbs was based on the premise
  that they didn't need to work in the city.
</p>

<p><strong>Streetcar Suburbs</strong></p>

<p>
  Until the appearance of trains/trolleys, people could only live in the suburbs
  at night and commute to work in the city during the day. Then the boundaries
  between the suburbs and the urban core began to blur. This marked the
  beginning of suburbanization.
</p>

<p>
  Here, the term "train" refers to a range of transportation modes, including
  earlier horse-drawn tramcars, often called "trams" or "trolleys," steam or
  internal combustion engine-driven cable cars, which were not self-propelled
  but were pulled along tracks by a cable, generally referred to as "cableways,"
  and vehicles that resemble today's streetcars/subways, including various forms
  of buses, subways, and light rail, which are their successors. Although their
  efficiency improved over time, their fundamental function remained largely
  unchanged. Therefore, we can discuss them as a category. Their defining
  features were that they were significantly faster than walking, had greater
  carrying capacity than horse-drawn carriages, and cost less than carriage
  rides. They saved time and money. Unlike cars, trains were public
  transportation and didn't offer door-to-door service.
</p>

<p><strong>Three Driving Forces</strong></p>

<p>
  The main drivers behind people's move to the suburbs can be summarized into
  three points. First, the pursuit of a more elegant environment and
  <strong>larger houses</strong>. Second, the <strong>lower</strong> cost of
  suburban <strong>rents </strong>or real estate prices. Third,
  <strong>affordable ticket </strong>prices for transportation. Let's discuss
  these in more detail.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Firstly</strong>, humans have a desire towards a more natural
  environment. Before the 19th century, the drinking water and public sanitation
  systems in large cities were relatively poor. Medical facilities were
  underdeveloped, and various epidemics were prevalent. Fire hazards were also a
  significant concern. The history of the Black Death is well known, but similar
  events occurred worldwide. In the late Eastern Han Dynasty, for instance, five
  of the famous Seven Scholars of Jian'an died in a plague in the city of Ye in
  that very year. Living in low-density suburbs still aligned with people's
  pursuit of health and safety, at least a hundred years ago.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Secondly</strong>, suburban land was more affordable. In the early
  20th century, trains were approximately five times faster than walking,
  roughly expanding the diameter of cities by a factor of five. Around the same
  time, train lines in New York extended up to 15 kilometers from the city
  center. Even medium-sized cities like Washington saw train lines extending
  seven to eight kilometers. The area available for suburban development
  increased by over 20 times. Previously, these suburban lands consisted of
  villages and farmland, making them quite inexpensive. Even with some price
  increases, they remained much more affordable than city centers. People had a
  much broader range of choices for building houses and could afford larger
  plots of land. Dreams of low-density living with large gardens that were
  impossible in the city became achievable in the era of trains. In that period,
  an average-income family had residential land in the city of approximately
  80-150 square meters with a building area of 80-150 square meters. In the
  suburbs, plots were roughly 300 square meters to 1000 square meters each, and
  house sizes often exceeded 200 square meters. Gardens and roads occupied a
  significant proportion of the surrounding area. Traditional urban areas had a
  gross floor area ratio of approximately 1.0, while new suburbs had a gross
  floor area ratio of approximately 0.2-0.5. In other words, the density of
  buildings in suburbs was equivalent to about one-fourth to one-half that of
  traditional urban areas.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Lastly</strong>, train ticket prices gradually became affordable.
  Currently, subway fares in China generally range from 3 to 10 yuan, which is
  relatively affordable. However, this is due to government subsidies. The
  actual cost of riding is two to three times higher than the ticket price. In
  the early 1900s, trains were generally operated as market-driven services.
  Around 1900, train tickets in major cities worldwide cost between 2 cents and
  1 cent, relative to the silver currency commonly used at that time. Most
  countries used silver coins weighing around 24-27 grams, including the US
  dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese Republic's "Yuan Datou," Canadian dollar, and
  Hong Kong dollar. This made price comparisons relatively straightforward.
  Monthly tickets ranged from 5 silver dollars to 8 silver dollars, equivalent
  to about $85 to $140 in today's US dollars. Currently, New York City's subway
  monthly pass costs $110, equivalent to 7 US dollars in 1900 (adjusted for
  inflation). This shows that the ticket prices in developed countries have
  remained relatively stable. Clearly, this was not cheap for Third World
  countries. In the early years of the Republic of China, the average monthly
  salary for white-collar workers in Shanghai was around 30 to 50 yuan, which
  was on the edge of being able to afford train tickets. Most people earned less
  than this. It's well known that in 1918, our great leader earned only 7 silver
  dollars per month while working as a librarian in Beijing, making daily train
  rides a challenge. Therefore, in the early 20th century, trains were a
  phenomenon primarily associated with the middle class, especially in East
  Asia. Train-induced suburbanization was not particularly evident.
</p>

<p>
  What were the monthly incomes of urban workers in the United States at that
  time? Around 1900, middle-class white-collar workers earned approximately
  $60-80 per month. Ordinary laborers or female workers earned only about $15
  per month. So, even in the United Kingdom and the United States, train-induced
  suburbanization was primarily a middle-class phenomenon. That's why the
  suburbs were called "garden suburbs" at the time. In London, this was
  reflected in the western suburbs like Hempstead, while in New York, it was
  evident in areas like Forest Hills in Queens. These were all residential areas
  for the middle class and above. However, in the early 20th century, income
  levels increased rapidly in the United Kingdom and the United States. By 1918,
  even the monthly wages of ordinary blue-collar workers had reached $100,
  meaning that trains had become accessible to the masses. Spending 10% of
  income on transportation was not too much, especially if housing expenses were
  reduced by moving to the suburbs. Therefore, the process of train-induced
  suburbanization, from being a phenomenon of the middle class to becoming
  accessible to the general population, was relatively short-lived.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, once the train-induced suburbanization model became accessible to
  the general population, it addressed not only the issues of improvement and
  cost savings but also led to an overall reduction in the cost of living. Young
  people who had just started working in the city, where rents were high, could
  opt to live in the suburbs. Although they needed to buy train tickets, the
  money saved on suburban rents often resulted in a surplus. Therefore, the
  suburbs played a significant role in solving housing problems for migrant
  workers and facilitating rapid urbanization. This phenomenon is evident in
  areas around New York, such as New Jersey, Queens, and the Bronx, in Tokyo
  with places like Nakano, Mitaka City, and Setagaya, in Beijing with areas like
  Tiantongyuan, Huilongguan, and Tongzhou, and in Hong Kong with districts like
  Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan. Of course, there are many nuances and interesting
  observations in the details of each of these suburban areas.
</p>

<p><strong>Suburban Patterns</strong></p>

<p>
  It's important to emphasize that train-induced suburbanization is
  significantly less intense than car-induced suburbanization, and it's not the
  same as what we see in today's suburbs. train stations and tracks occupy
  relatively small spaces. Therefore, the layout of train suburbs closely
  resembles a low-density extension of traditional urban areas, as I mentioned
  earlier. It can achieve a population density of 5,000 to 10,000 people per
  square kilometer. This mechanism easily increases density and creates a
  pattern that resembles traditional urban areas. Initially, it was the middle
  class building large houses in the suburbs.
</p>

<p>
  As train efficiency improved and ticket prices decreased, the working-class
  joined the suburban dream. They chose less expensive locations or smaller
  houses, forming a mosaic of communities alongside the upper-middle class.

<p>
  These garden suburbs typically extended about one kilometer from the train
  stations. Small commercial areas developed around the train stations. Train
  lines typically radiated out from the edges of the old city centers, extending
  in a radial pattern. The garden suburbs wrapped around these train lines,
  shaping the city's development pattern into the form of a hand. The
  traditional urban area resembled the palm of the hand, while the garden
  suburbs extended like fingers, and the small commercial areas near the train
  stations were like the joints of the fingers.
</p>

<p>
  These joints, which are what we now call TOD (Transit-Oriented Development),
  although they weren't referred to as such back then, harbored many urban
  economic phenomena. Its most developed manifestation can be seen in Tokyo.
</p>

<p><strong>Culture</strong></p>

<p>
  Trains or subway systems form vast and intricate machinery systems in cities.
  They are the arteries of the economy, yet they can be grand, even mysterious,
  and labyrinthine in appearance. They can be iconic and objects of admiration.
  The daily movement of millions of people within this group can even take on a
  ritualistic quality. Furthermore, this movement often appears highly
  organized.
</p>

<p>
  It's remarkable that ancestors who were once innocent and carefree
  hunter-gatherers could collectively navigate a labyrinthine subway network
  with complex signaling systems. This seems to be a testament to the profound
  adaptability of human nature.
</p>

<p>
  Trains have become significant symbols of urban culture, embodying certain
  lifestyles and attitudes. The train system was initially a phenomenon of urban
  mechanization, a step up in social constraints, and the individualization of
  personal space. It became a material carrier of urban collectivism and
  community worship. Participation in the public transportation system signified
  acceptance of a somewhat alienated lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
  This can be seen as an ideology embracing the future, embracing more complex
  constraints.
</p>

<p>
  It can even carry a sense of moral superiority, enough to differentiate
  between groups. The same route may be taken by an office worker who knows it
  like the back of their hand, and a stranger, but they may never form a
  societal bond. In other words, people who are face-to-face with you may not
  actually exert any real constraint on you. Is this not freedom under
  constraint?
</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p>
  Firstly, train technology matured, expanding the commutable diameter of cities
  by about five times. This led to the emergence of mega-cities. Using a
  biological analogy, efficient circulation systems and enhanced oxygen
  transport capacity inevitably lead to the evolution of larger organisms, which
  also develop new characteristics.
</p>

<p>
  These transportation systems significantly increased the amount of land
  available for development and lowered land prices. Initially, they addressed
  the issues of improving housing environments and creating suburban gardens.
</p>

<p>
  Then, when the monthly income of the average worker reached a certain level,
  around the time of World War I in the UK and the US, trains in the suburbs
  became a worker-friendly lifestyle choice. This helped fuel rapid population
  growth in major cities.
</p>

<p>
  Trains drove suburban development in a finger-like pattern. Their density was
  not particularly low, resembling traditional downtown areas.
</p>

<p>
  However, soon, while trains were still trying to expand their market share in
  some cities, in other places, they lost ground to cars. Cars became dominant
  in most economically developed regions. Nonetheless, trains demonstrated
  remarkable vitality in specific areas of very large cities.
</p>

<p>
  Commuting and transportation, in a sense, represent the cellularization of
  humanity.
</p>

<p>
  In traditional cities, people mainly walked, incurring almost no
  transportation costs.
</p>

<p>Trams cost around 1000-2000 a month; cars are 2-3 times more expensive.</p>

<p>
  I boldly predict that with the proliferation of autonomous shared vehicles,
  transportation costs will continue to decrease, intensifying suburbanization.
  Subway systems will face significant challenges and may gradually become
  burdensome for cities, or even phased out. Private cars will continue to exist
  as luxury items.
</p>

<p>
  This will lead to a widening gap between densely populated urban areas and
  sparsely populated suburbs.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, transportation expenses will account for around 10% of
  workers' incomes, while in the same era…
</p>

<p>
  Please pay attention to the proportion of transportation expenses relative to
  income and its trends.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, in the United States, household transportation expenditures average
  16% of total expenditures, housing accounts for 33%, and food only 14%.
</p>
