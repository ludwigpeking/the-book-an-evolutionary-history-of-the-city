  This talk, which explores the relationship between city defense systems and
  social structures, follows Lecture 6 of the larger seminar series on Urban
  Evolution titled "The Game of Thrones—Castle Economics."
</p>

<p>
  As I mentioned before, a human settlement, whether originating from a fortress
  of an armed group, a holy land or temple, or an oasis for water collection
  along a trade route, will eventually converge and integrate into a city with
  defenses, religion, and economics. These cities form spatial structures with
  distinct inner and outer layers.
</p>

<p>
  In this context, defense structures like towers and city walls serve as the
  city's exoskeleton, revealing its form and reflecting its social structure.
  Understanding this offers a wealth of knowledge about the history of cities.
  If you look at ancient records with reactions like, "Ah, glory! Ah,
  greatness!" then you're merely a casual observer.
</p>

<p>
  A typical city defense structure includes a central castle, inner city, and
  outer city. I won't go into the details here as I've discussed it before.
  These walls not only serve as defenses but also demarcate the community's
  security boundaries. Inside the inner city wall live the so-called "citizens"
  of the Zhou dynasty, the colonizers and rulers. Outside the outer city wall
  are the "barbarians," those who are colonized or ruled. The area between these
  walls is a gray zone, a space for people who are still in a probationary
  citizen phase.
</p>

<p>
  How does an outer city develop? Citizens and "barbarians" frequently trade,
  and these "barbarians" who engage in trade and services gather near the city
  gates. Initially, they establish markets and residential areas in an ad-hoc
  manner, forming temporary occupations. These settlements eventually gain
  recognition and evolve into established communities, often with strong
  commercial characteristics. Examples include the East Gate in ancient Xi'an,
  Qianmen Street in Beijing, and commercial districts in Vienna and London
  during Roman times.
</p>

<p>
  When it comes to the 'barbarians', they engage in economic collaborations with
  the 'citizens' through these communities, forming trade relationships. These
  collaborators hold a precarious status—somewhere between citizens and
  barbarians, similar to collaborators during wars.
</p>

<p>
  These commercial areas outside the city gates lack protection from city walls
  and can be abandoned during enemy attacks. For example, during the Ming
  Dynasty, Beijing was never conquered by the Mongols or the Qing Dynasty, but
  the surrounding villages were looted several times.
</p>

<p>
  The enemy could also use these external communities as hiding places and siege
  bases. For instance, in 1852, the Qing Dynasty destroyed Wuchang's external
  communities to prevent the Taiping army from having hiding places, resulting
  in a humanitarian disaster.
</p>

<p>
  As integration deepens, these communities become more like citizens,
  economically and politically important. They are often enclosed by new walls,
  forming the lower or outer city. This concentric structure of cities becomes
  clearly visible in their physical exoskeleton.
</p>

<p>
  Originally, the inner city housed first-class citizens, the lower city had
  second-class citizens, and now with the advent of an outer city, there are
  third-class citizens. This makes the second-class citizens feel closer to the
  first-class citizens, indicating successful integration.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, these exoskeletons can both expand and shrink. For example, Yuan
  Dadu on the north side was not fully filled, so the Ming Dynasty shrunk it by
  three kilometers to the south for easier defense and better public safety
  management.
</p>

<p>
  This concentric design, a typical mono-core defense structure, reflects a
  pyramid-like social structure.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  Cities are not necessarily mono-centric; other structures exist, such as
  polycentric ones, which reflect federated social structures. The most famous
  example is ancient Rome. Initially, three tribes coexisted, forming several
  fortified settlements on Rome's seven hills and constituting a tribal
  federation. The Latin tribe was the primary tribe, while the Sabines and
  Etruscans were guest tribes. Over generations of integration, the federation
  stabilized, and the tribes completely assimilated. The flatlands between the
  forts developed into commercial areas, eventually unifying into a single
  defense system represented by the Servian Wall, which surrounded all seven
  hills. Once unified, the individual forts became irrelevant for defense,
  giving way to an open community structure. By then, the Roman city-state was
  undoubtedly established.
</p>

<p>
  By the 3rd century AD, Rome expanded significantly beyond the walls. Due to
  its uncontested rule over the empire, and a period of peace, the walls became
  unnecessary. Rome during this era was essentially a wall-less open city.
  Similar open cities have appeared in ancient history, such as in ancient Egypt
  and Central America, but they were usually short-lived and did not form a
  lasting trend. By the 4th century, during the reign of Aurelian and with the
  threat of barbarian invasions, Rome built an even larger new set of walls,
  which still stand today. This is a typical case of urban expansion.
</p>

<p>
  Conversely, the disintegration of power and political fragmentation can lead
  to the decay of city defenses. The thousand years from the fall of the Roman
  Empire to the Renaissance saw a fragmented Europe, exemplified by tower-filled
  cities in Northern Italy like Siena, Bologna, and San Gimignano. These reflect
  a shift in defense from a unified public service to family-based units.
  Complex diplomatic and alliance relations existed among families within these
  cities, along with intermittent civil wars. This was, in essence, a reversal
  of the process through which Roman city-states and the empire formed.
</p>

<p>
  Kyoto in Japan experienced a similar situation. Established in the 8th
  century, originally known as Heian-kyo, it was ambitiously planned but was
  never even half filled. The planning exceeded the actual needs and
  capabilities of the Heian regime. With the failure of the Ritsuryo state
  system, Heian-kyo devolved into disconnected, fortified islands representing
  various feudal lords. Each had its own walls, towers, and even moats.
  Essentially, the national capital's defense disintegrated, and lords, temples,
  and noble officials had to fend for themselves or seek protection from more
  capable lords.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, Honnoji, where Oda Nobunaga met his end, was not a simple guest
  house; it was a fortress. The Kyoto Imperial Palace also had its own
  independent walls and moats. Moreover, there were large fortresses like Nijo
  Castle and Fushimi Castle, each with its own defense systems and even their
  commercial service systems in the lower cities.
</p>

<p>
  Returning to the main point, are mono-centric cities truly mono-centric? The
  relationship between Constantinople and Galata, for example, reflected an
  alliance between the Byzantines, Varangians, and Genoese. The relationship
  between Westminster and London symbolized the alliance between the British
  monarch and the urban bourgeoisie.
</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<p>
  Mono-centric forms reflect a more polarized governance structure, while
  alliance forms have more complex internal tensions. However, there is never an
  absolutely singular governance; elements of alliance always exist and manifest
  in the details of the city.
</p>

<p>
  These forms are either in the process of integration or disintegration,
  depending on the success of the unification efforts.
</p>

<p>
  Some cities expand, growing additional layers of city gates and outer walls.
  Conversely, there are cities that contract, either due to the collapse of
  governance, resource depletion, or external pressures, resulting in a reduced
  scale of city defenses.
</p>

<p>
  In the modern era, especially after the Franco-Prussian War, the advent of
  heavy artillery made walls and towers obsolete. Some cities have preserved
  these walls as historical landmarks or parks. Most cities entered a phase of
  dismantling their walls and moats.
</p>

<p>
  Once these fortifications are removed, they often become wide, circular roads,
  usually lined with trees and green spaces. These roads are specifically termed
  "Boulevards," originally referring to bulwarks or protruding gun platforms on
  city walls. The term "Boulevard" has now been redefined to mean wide,
  tree-lined avenues. In Vienna, it's called the "Ring Strasse," and in Moscow,
  it's directly called the "Boulevard Ring." Beijing's Second Ring Road could
  well be named the "Boulevard Ring" as it was indeed built after the
  dismantling of city fortifications in the 1960s.
</p>

<p>
  Modern city defenses adapted to contemporary warfare usually appear as
  inconspicuous bunkers, integrated with barbed-wire fences and trench systems.
  They are unobtrusive and do not take up much space.
</p>

<p>
  The advent of the nation-state has significantly diminished the rural-urban
  divide. The equipment gap between regular army and militias widened, making a
  diverse armed force implausible and leading to flatter internal structures.
</p>

<p>
  All of these have contributed to the disappearance of walls and the emergence
  of more open cities, leading to more sprawling urban expansion. We will
  discuss later the suburbanization and urban sprawl resulting from new means of
  transportation like trams, cars, and elevators.
</p>

<p>
  However, that does not mean enclosed fortifications have disappeared. They
  still exist in the form of military installations, government buildings,
  institutions, corporations, and even schools. Sometimes, these are referred to
  as "compounds," featuring strict security measures. Prisons are universally
  enclosed fortifications. In China, even residential areas often have security
  gates. These fortifications honestly reflect the tension between them and the
  outside world. I had discussed this in greater detail in my 2016 New Year's
  discussion on block zoning.
</p>

<p>
  Up next, I will discuss the evolution of cities brought about by modes of
  transportation like trams, cars, and elevators.
