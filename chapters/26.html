<h1>26 Vertical Development</h1>

<p><strong>The Value of Density</strong></p>

<p>
  Cities generate value by fostering an environment for collaborative
  specialization. High population density amplifies the efficiency of this
  collaborative specialization. Delivery drivers, taxi operators, and restaurant
  owners can most intimately attest to how population density enhances their
  operational efficiency. While other industries might not have such a direct
  perception of the impact of population density, it doesn't necessarily mean
  they benefit any less from it.
</p>

<p>
  In traditional urban centers, temples, assemblies, courts, marketplaces,
  commercial streets, and even public recreational spots served as hubs of
  collaboration. In ancient Rome, it was the bathhouses. In certain locales, it
  might have been brothels or taverns. These places were the pivot points where
  urban collaboration occurred.
</p>

<p><strong>Spatial Economics and Vertical Expansion</strong></p>

<p>
  A typical day's wage for regular labor might amount to a couple of hundred
  yuan. In contrast, for entrepreneurs, lawyers, financiers, and top-tier
  technical experts, daily earnings could reach thousands or even tens of
  thousands of yuan. It's not uncommon for specialized agencies to charge fees
  amounting to thousands per hour. Businesspeople often handle transactions
  worth millions or even billions on a daily basis. Whether a financier can
  attend three meetings or four within a day makes a significant difference.
</p>

<p>
  In most professions, spending thirty to fifty yuan per employee daily on
  office space is pretty standard. However, financial enterprises may spend
  several hundred yuan daily for each financier and their support staff. Hence,
  selecting a more convenient and centralized location becomes incredibly
  worthwhile. The variation in property prices and rents across different areas
  can be tenfold, sometimes even more, precisely because of these
  considerations.
</p>

<p>
  This leads to a strong inclination towards consolidation. In spatial terms,
  there's a push to maximize land usage with buildings. Once the land is fully
  utilized, the only direction left is up, which prompts the addition of more
  floors, leading to vertical transportation. Each building can be thought of as
  a street stretching vertically to the sky. The entrance to the first floor
  serves as the entrance to this vertical street. This 'street' culminates at
  the topmost floor, akin to a dead-end. To exit, one must descend back down and
  leave from the same first-floor entry point.
</p>

<p>
  One can imagine that businesses would most likely thrive only at the beginning
  of such a dead-end, the first floor, which is part of the ground space and
  hence more accessible. The rent for the second floor is approximately 60% of
  the first floor's, while the third floor is around 40% of the first.
  Staircases and other transit spaces reduce the usability of the space; higher
  floors come with increased structural costs; and moving goods up and down is
  inconvenient. Therefore, in most cases, adding more floors yields diminishing
  returns. However, as long as the marginal benefit remains positive, adding
  more floors is viable.
</p>

<p><strong>Higher Rises in Antiquity and Medieval</strong></p>

<p>
  In fact, two or three-story houses were common in the ancient world. As is
  well known, Wu Dalang lived in a multi-story building; otherwise, Pan
  Jinlian's clothesline wouldn't have hit Xi Menqing. (<strong
    >Footnote:</strong
  >
  Wu Dalang, Pan Jinlian, and Xi Menqing are characters from the classic Chinese
  novel "The Water Margin" (also known as "Outlaws of the Marsh"). In one of its
  episodes, Pan Jinlian, Wu Dalang's wife, drops an object from their
  multi-story building that accidentally hits Xi Menqing, sparking a series of
  events. This reference is used to highlight the existence of multi-story
  residences in ancient narratives.)
</p>

<p>
  Treehouses and stilted buildings are among the foundational architectural
  types. In flood-prone areas, the ground floor is susceptible to flooding and
  tends to be damp. Venice, with its four daily tides, epitomizes this. Almost
  no Venetian building has only one story; otherwise, the constant flooding
  would be unbearable. A typical three-story structure had the ground floor for
  shops, studios, and servant rooms. The top floor was an attic, hot in summer
  and cold in winter, used mainly for storage or secondary purposes. The second
  floor was the most comfortable and housed the primary suite.
</p>

<p>
  Having a two or three-story house generally indicated a financially stable
  family. Such homes weren't exceptionally small as they needed space for
  stairs, usually more than 150 square meters.
</p>

<p>
  However, buildings exceeding three stories were rare in the ancient world.
  They were most likely multi-tenant apartments, representing advanced urban
  economies. Carthage, Rome's rival and a major trading port, was predominantly
  comprised of six-story buildings—the approximate limit for human endurance.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, there were exceptions. Some Roman apartment buildings reached nine
  stories. One can imagine how tiring climbing nine floors would be. These
  weren't luxurious dwellings. However, for their residents, living there was
  probably more convenient than residing several kilometers outside the city
  center. Notably, for safety reasons, during the Roman Empire, height
  restrictions were imposed on residential buildings, limiting most within the
  city to five stories.
</p>

<p>
  Early Roman cityscape was dominated by courtyards with a few apartment
  buildings rising above, resembling islands in a sea. Hence, in Latin,
  apartments were termed "insula." Due to population and economic growth up to
  the fourth century, the number of apartment buildings surged while single
  units dwindled. Buildings of three to five stories became the norm, accounting
  for over 90% of the structures. This pattern matches ancient Italian cities we
  can observe today. In pre-industrial Florence, Siena, Venice, Pisa, Bologna,
  and even 1881 New York, buildings rarely exceeded six or seven stories. This
  reflects a quasi-equilibrium in architectural styles for that technological
  era. Such cities had high building coverages and dense populations. Buildings
  occupied 40%-80% of land in central and commercial areas, with sunnier cities
  having even higher coverages. The total volume-to-area ratio could locally
  reach 1.5-2.5. Outlying city areas, especially those away from gates and main
  roads or in low-lying areas, might have vast vegetable gardens. On average,
  the entire city would have a ratio close to 1, with population densities
  exceeding 20,000 people per square kilometer, sometimes even reaching over
  40,000 in specific areas.

<p>
  <strong>The Elevator Revolution and the Higher Rises in Modern Times</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This balance was disrupted with the advent of the elevator in the 19th
  century. In 1852, the American Elisha Otis invented the safety elevator. By
  1870, the nine-story, 47-meter-tall Equitable Life Building was equipped with
  ten elevators, replacing stairs as the primary means of vertical
  transportation within the building.
</p>

<p>
  When Li Hongzhang visited New York in 1896, he saw numerous buildings over 20
  stories high. He stayed at the 13-story old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel located on
  Fifth Avenue, not the current one on Park Avenue, and rode its elevators,
  which left a profound impression on him.
</p>

<p>
  By this time, elevator technology had matured considerably. Steel framing was
  becoming widespread, leading to the rise of skyscrapers. In 1913, the
  38-story, 169-meter-tall Equitable Building was erected, boasting a plot ratio
  of 27.5.
</p>

<p>
  This record was surpassed in 1931 with the construction of the 381-meter-tall,
  102-story Empire State Building. Some city districts had a floor-area ratio
  (FAR) of over 10, underpinned by the advancements in elevator technology.
</p>

<p>
  One could draw parallels between elevators and trams. Both emerged around the
  same time and share technological foundations. While one expanded the city
  horizontally, the other did so vertically, stretching urban dimensions by more
  than five times.
</p>

<p>
  Despite this, New York introduced building setback and FAR regulations in
  1916. However, setting these rules aside, technologically, there's no ceiling
  to increasing urban density. Economically, it's feasible too. Even if the
  construction cost of a super-tall building is 10,000 yuan more per square
  meter than a regular one, and the building cost per square meter can exceed
  20,000 yuan, as long as the office space can be sold for 30,000 yuan per
  square meter, the value generated can cover the added costs and the cost of
  capital. Building more can reduce the cost of land.
</p>

<p><strong>High-Rises and Social Dynamics</strong></p>

<p>
  Before elevators, higher floors were cheaper. After their advent, the higher
  you went, the more expensive it became. This shift led to the concept of
  penthouses as depicted in "The Devil's Advocate."
</p>

<p>
  More importantly, elevators increased the density of traditional urban areas,
  relieving the pressure to expand into suburban areas and occupy more land.
  They also reduced the overall travel distances within cities, enhancing the
  efficiency of public transportation and decreasing the reliance on personal
  vehicles.
</p>

<p>
  From a topological perspective, elevators and stairwells are analogous to
  cul-de-sacs in suburban areas or dead-end streets in cities. As a result, they
  share similar characteristics. Those who use elevators or staircases are
  typically residents of the building. No external traffic passes through, and
  there aren't any casual visitors. Hence, there's naturally less foot traffic,
  which in certain eras made these areas prime spots for crime.
</p>

<p>
  With the emergence of property management and security systems, these problems
  have largely been addressed, albeit with increased maintenance costs.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, in residential buildings, much like suburban dead-ends,
  residents are homogeneous with little natural cooperation or interaction,
  unlike the organic collaborations found among village or town merchants.
  Consequently, homeowners' associations, made up of strangers, can be rigid and
  have weaker inherent organizational strength, making it harder to manage the
  shared building. Mismanagement and decline of mass housing, affordable
  housing, and collective housing are prevalent, jeopardizing the long-term
  interests of residents.
</p>

<p>
  A notable case is the Pruitt-Igoe housing complex in St. Louis, built in the
  1950s. Despite housing 2,800 units in 33 high-rises resembling many modern
  Chinese residential compounds, it faced increasing vacancy rates and became a
  hotspot for vandalism. Less than 20 years after its construction, the entire
  complex was demolished in 1972, marking one of the most significant failures
  of treating high-rises as social engineering projects.
</p>

<p>
  However, the visionary Swiss architect Le Corbusier, often considered a
  pioneer in viewing high-rises as tools for social engineering, had long
  provided a solution to this issue. In his iconic Unité d'Habitation in
  Marseille, he designed a vertical mixed-use concept, brilliantly executed in
  the project.
</p>

<p>
  The ground floor, a heroic open space, features only one entrance. The second
  and third floors contain split-level apartments, which span the building's
  second to seventh floors due to their design. The fourth and fifth floors,
  which are effectively the eighth and ninth, house a two-story commercial
  street with cafes, architectural bookstores, other shops, studios, and a
  hotel. The roof offers a nursery and a multipurpose hall for exhibitions and
  performances.
</p>

<p>
  While this design creates many opportunities for interaction within the
  building, its practical implementation has some challenges. For instance, if
  all 337 units were occupied, there would only be a few children of nursery
  age, insufficient to sustain a full-scale nursery.
</p>

<p><strong>The Vision of Mega Structures</strong></p>

<p>
  The concept of designing massive integrated buildings—known as "Mega
  Structures"—that serve as mini-cities or communities is intriguing. These
  structures are part of the modernist utopian architectural experiments,
  reflecting the desire to design entire ecosystems or lifestyles in one go.
  However, real-world examples of such successful implementations are rare.

<p>
  Projects like Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Canary Wharf and King's Cross in
  London, Grand Central Terminal and Hudson Yards in New York, seem to be moving
  in this direction. Instead of adopting the unilateral and utopian approaches
  of mega-structures, these developments favor broader collaborations, complex
  stakeholder negotiations, and long-term cycles spanning decades. They manage
  to achieve a high FAR while ensuring a relatively comfortable environment that
  is human-centric, showcasing the pinnacle of human urban construction
  capability.
