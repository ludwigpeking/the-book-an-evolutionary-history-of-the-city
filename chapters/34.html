<h1>
  34 the Language of Designing the Plan (3) Special Diagrams, Freeform Curves
</h1>

<p>
  In the previous two chapters, I discussed two languages of urban design: one
  is the grid road network, and the second is the radial road network. In this
  article, we continue discussing the language of urban design. The third type
  involves city design using diagramatic special patterns. If the first two
  types are mainstream or quite common, then this third type is relatively
  non-mainstream.
</p>

<p>
  In my 32nd lecture I talked about circular cities. This can be considered as a
  special pattern, which actually should be the content of this chapter. It is
  an evolutionary product related to city defense efficiency. If you don't
  recall, you can review it. I won't repeat it here.
</p>

<p><strong>Diagramatic Patterns - Mandala</strong></p>

<p>
  After being symbolized and conceptualized, the circle sometimes gets referred
  to as the Mandala, which in Buddhism carries many mystical meanings. A city
  planned according to the Mandala that you might be familiar with is Shenyang
  (Feng-Tien or Mukden) during the Later Jin Dynasty. Shenyang, during the Ming
  Dynasty, was a small square fortress. After being occupied by the Jurchens,
  Tibetan Buddhist monks were brought in to redesign and expand it, wrapping a
  circle around the original square fortress. With a circle outside and a square
  inside, the main roads inside the city form a grid, dividing the Mandala into
  nine sections. The original square fortress became the imperial city,
  occupying the central section. This created a new, magical shape, akin to a
  Mandala. This shape is filled with mystical significance while preserving the
  original infrastructure. Emperor Qianlong praised it as a genius renovation.

<p>
  Even without considering its mystical layers, the two layers of city walls
  meet the general requirements of a defense system; the grid-patterned main
  streets, with eight city gates, are more suited for a large city compared to
  the Ming Dynasty's standardized fortress with a cross-shaped main street and
  four city gates. Having two roads in each direction forms what urban design
  calls "alternative roads", so if one is blocked, there's another route
  available. This enhances so-called traffic resilience.
</p>

<p><strong>Diagramatic Patterns - Polygonal</strong></p>

<p>
  Besides the circular or Mandala pattern, which is a relatively common special
  urban design, there are other unique patterns that manifest in triangles,
  squares, pentagons, hexagons and other regular polygons. They are typically
  fortresses or Renaissance-style strongholds, often adorned with intricate
  lotus petal or even snowflake-shaped multi-layered defensive structures. These
  designs have no relation to decorative art but are the creations of advanced
  military engineering. They are designed to protect their inhabitants while
  exposing invading enemies to gunfire or forcing them to navigate through
  deadly traps enveloped by firepower. Their geometric shapes correlate with the
  firing angles of cannons and the coverage of crossfire. Due to the
  standardized use of cannons, fortress shapes became symmetrical. The
  performance parameters of the cannons greatly influenced their designs,
  resulting in highly mechanized structures. For instance, the shape of an
  aircraft carrier deck is determined by the takeoff and landing distances of
  its planes, just as the layout of an opera house is determined by the size of
  its stage and the distance from which the audience can see clearly.

<p>
  Generally, the larger the fortress, the more turrets it has, and the more
  sides it possesses. The smallest is triangular, also called a trilateral
  fortress. Common ones include quadrilateral, pentagonal, and hexagonal
  fortresses. Larger examples, such as the Palmanova fortress built by the
  Venetian Republic in the 16th century, are nonagonal, which is very close to
  being circular.
</p>

<p>
  These star-shaped bastions have left a significant imprint on urban history.
  Their distinct features include immense size; for comparison, the triple walls
  of Constantinople from the Roman era spanned only 50 meters in depth. In
  contrast, the depth of these star-shaped bastions often reached four to five
  hundred meters. Yet, the usable area within them, even in large bastions like
  Palmanova, was only around 400 meters in radius. As a result, military
  structures took up over 70% of the city's total area. These massive
  constructs, despite being sturdy and durable, demanded significant effort to
  dismantle. Hence, unless there was a compelling reason for urban development
  in recent times, these structures were often left untouched or repurposed for
  modern military use. Sometimes, they were even integrated with hills and
  became urban parks. For instance, Florence has two notable star-shaped
  bastions, with one situated atop the hill of the Pitti Palace. The Pentagon,
  the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, clearly pays
  homage to this classic military architecture.
</p>

<p><strong>Celestial Patterns</strong></p>

<p>
  Additionally, there have been attempts throughout history to design palaces,
  buildings, and monuments that mimic celestial patterns. Xianyang, the capital
  city of the Qin Dynasty, was designed on a vast scale, spanning over 10
  kilometers, with considerations mirroring celestial patterns. As I mentioned
  before, such designs signify the rulers' intellectual superiority and were
  sometimes related to magical practices. While this series won't delve into the
  details of these practices, it's essential to acknowledge their historical
  significance.
</p>

<p><strong>Political Placing</strong></p>

<p>
  Aside from the aforementioned patterns, there's another intriguing urban
  design linked to the layouts of various Chinese local governmental complexes,
  which are constituted of the Communist headquarter, administration branch, the
  congress, the PCC, the court and the Procuratorate. While there's no fixed
  template for these designs, ongoing experimentation has suggested that spacing
  them apart might be optimal, helping avoid potential sensitivities.

<p><em>the government complex of Beijing</em></p>

<p>
  For instance, the layout of Washington D.C. revolves around the large National
  Mall's cross axis. Four endpoints and one intersection define this space: The
  White House and the Capitol Building each occupy one endpoint, while the
  Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials sit at the other two. The Washington Monument
  is at the intersection. But where is the U.S. Supreme Court? It's tucked
  behind and to the side of the Capitol without even a face on the Mall. A
  critical observer (with CCP sensitivity) might ask, "Isn't the separation of
  powers essential? Why does the executive branch, represented by the president,
  have the most prominent spots?"
</p>

<p>
  In conclusion, while grid and radial layouts primarily relate to
  transportation and efficiency, unique shapes reflect other sociocultural and
  natural dynamics. Though they might not dominate urban history, their
  influence cannot be overlooked.
</p>

<p><strong>Freefrom Curves</strong></p>

<p>
  Next, I'd like to introduce the final type of language in the four major
  categories of urban design that I've identified: the "Freeform Curve." It
  refers to a type of curve that does not have a clear mathematical expression
  and is influenced by various factors, making it winding and undulating.
</p>

<p>
  Strictly speaking, "Freeform Curve" isn't a standard term. One might argue
  that the term overextends the use of the word "free." Is a curve truly free?
  If I take a pen and draw a line arbitrarily, is that line truly free? Can I
  freely draw any line? In reality, no. The lines I draw waver, varying in
  thickness and curvature, constrained by my hand-eye coordination. They're also
  influenced by my breathing, heartbeat, muscle strength, and more. The
  composite of all these factors results in the jitter of the line. Art
  historians can discern Vincent van Gogh's syphilis from his later paintings
  based on this.
</p>

<p><strong>From Topology</strong></p>

<p>
  Such curves are unpredictable due to the complex forces behind them.For
  instance, consider a path taken by a person leading a donkey: it represents a
  weighted combination of the person's and donkey's will, with the weighting
  fluctuating based on the changing strengths of their intentions.Our urban and
  rural landscapes are filled with various curves, primarily stemming from
  topography.Landforms result from multilayered influences accumulating over
  vast historical periods. Factors like the actions of rivers, tectonic plate
  movements, volcanic and meteoric impacts, oceanic forces, air movements,
  biological activities, glaciers, gravitational and tidal effects, and human
  activities each leave unique imprints on the land. Geomorphology is a
  fascinating field about evolution. While I am captivated by its insights, I'm
  not an expert, so I won't delve too deeply here.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout most of history, human ability to alter landforms was limited. For
  instance, ancient civilizations in mountainous regions, without the means or
  rationale to engage in massive earthworks, built roads and houses that
  naturally followed the contours of the terrain. The Coriolis effect, due to
  Earth's rotation, also makes rivers tend to meander, continuously changing
  their course due to erosion and sediment deposition. This winding,
  unpredictable world is what humans have observed for millions of years.
  Although straight, man-made structures have emerged over the last 5,000 years,
  they didn't dominate the landscape for a significant period.
</p>

<p>
  This winding nature has been preserved in many artistic works, such as ancient
  and modern landscape paintings, and the delicate patterns on Oriental
  porcelain and embroidery. This so-called "meandering" has become a conceptual
  entity, leaving a lasting impression and gradually evolving into a design
  language.
</p>

<p><strong>Into a Design Language</strong></p>

<p>
  In modern designs, even in places without significant topographic changes or
  rivers, winding forms are intentionally incorporated. Examples include the
  Suzhou gardens, Japanese gardens, London's Regent's Park, Bath's Royal
  Crescent, and Beijing's Financial Street. All these designs showcase memorable
  curved compositions. Some might be influenced by local topography, existing
  streets, and buildings, while others are purely conceptual. They're abstracted
  into design languages, no longer grounded in specific contexts, but originate
  from ideas, becoming the so-called "Freeform Curve."

<p>
  In places like Riverside in Chicago and many suburban housing areas on flat
  terrains, winding designs are intentionally used. In many residential areas in
  modern China, pathways, which could be straight, often meander intentionally.
  Or houses are purposely shaped like crescents. This design language is termed
  "<strong>the picturesque</strong>" — which translates to "painting-like." It
  imitates the winding nature of landscape paintings, attempting to recreate the
  impression of nature. This design style, exemplified by Beijing's Olympic
  Forest Park and Chaoyang Park, has become a standard technique in many urban
  parks. Such designs may seem arbitrary or even inefficient, but they work as
  urban "magic" – even man-made nature can provide relaxing effects.
</p>

<p>
  The above sums up the last of the four urban design languages I've discussed.
  There are others, like skylines, public spaces, and street systems, all
  evolving from spontaneous development to intentional design, which I'll
  discuss in the future.
</p>

<p><strong>Reflections</strong>:</p>

<p>
  There's a common misconception that all urban designs are visionary
  masterpieces. However, the reality is that urban design is not just about
  success stories, but more about failures. Drawing an analogy from an
  experiment on oral herpes virus, artificially induced genetic mutations were
  mostly harmful at 71%, ineffective at 27%, with only 2% being beneficial.
  Failure is a significant part of evolution. If failures didn't exist,
  dinosaurs might have reached Mars by now.
</p>

<p>
  Most urban design languages emerge from the spontaneous order created by
  evolution. Yet, they are often used inappropriately due to a lack of complete
  understanding.
</p>

<p>
  The ancient cities that have survived to this day appear to be intricately
  designed compared to many modern cities. This isn't necessarily because our
  ancestors were more insightful. They undoubtedly made numerous flawed designs.
  Most of these didn't stand the test of time, and what remains are the
  relatively harmonious and sensible designs. For instance, an animal that has
  evolved over millions of years is likely far more refined than a toy recently
  invented by a child.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, when observed closely, machines invented by humans have surpassed the
  capabilities of organisms that have evolved over billions of years in certain
  areas, such as speed, strength, and computational power. Similarly, modern
  cities designed by humans, in terms of localized density and transportation
  capacity, far exceed that of traditional cities. This means that both
  effective and flawed designs are being produced simultaneously. Judging them
  requires profound insight.
</p>

<p>
  From a futuristic perspective, humans may design even stronger cities,
  inventing new segments of cities and new languages of design. Eventually, some
  of these innovations will survive through evolution and become the classics of
  the future.
