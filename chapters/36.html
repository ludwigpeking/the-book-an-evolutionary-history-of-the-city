<h1>36 Skyline: as an Language of Modern Urban Design</h1>

<p>
  In this issue, we extend the previous discussion on skylines, emphasizing
  their role in reflecting the internal structure of power and wealth within a
  city. A skyline shapes social prestige for certain groups and is often imbued
  with ideological significance. Given the chance, those in power might seek to
  influence or design the skyline to communicate specific narratives. In this
  context, the skyline becomes an integral aspect of urban design.
</p>

<p>
  In early cities, towers and lofty buildings served as symbols of sovereignty
  for the lords, a means to deter enemies, and a mechanism to instill labor
  discipline among the populace. Religious groups built tall temples to deepen
  the reverence of their followers. This construction of towers, largely driven
  by religious entities, is in essence, an act of city design focused on
  erecting monuments symbolizing power and ideology. However, there was
  generally no concerted effort to intervene in architectural developments on a
  broader scale.
</p>

<p>
  As mentioned before, New York City Hall was once built high to underscore its
  prominence. However, without suppressing the rise of other tall buildings, its
  prominence was short-lived and soon overshadowed. Yet, this is not to be
  construed as a failure of New York. The interpretation of success or failure
  hinges on perspective. For some advocates of small government, the inability
  to dominate the skyline might be seen as a testament to the city's restraint
  and indicative of a service-oriented governance model, not an overpowering
  entity eager to impose its will.
</p>

<p>
  Now, let us briefly turn our attention to how the control of skylines varies
  across cities worldwide.
</p>

<p><strong>Tokyo - Skyline Reflecting Neighborhood Restrictions</strong></p>

<p>
  In Japan, there exist legislations that limit building heights. However, these
  laws are primarily in place to maintain harmony within communities rather than
  to satisfy anyone’s architectural ambitions. In Tokyo, it’s common to find
  high-rise buildings interspersed within single-household urban villages. Yet,
  within these areas, high-rises are generally dispersed rather than clustered,
  with neighborhood coordination being a significant obstacle to their
  construction. In areas where the cost of such coordination is too high,
  approvals for high-rise buildings are less likely.
</p>

<p>
  In Tokyo, deliberate skyline design is scarcely evident. Contrary to common
  assertions in China that tall buildings should not be constructed near the
  Forbidden City to preserve the ancient capital's ambiance, Tokyo's Marunouchi
  area, which is most densely populated with skyscrapers, is directly adjacent
  to the Imperial Palace. "Marunouchi" literally translates to the core area
  within the city walls.
</p>

<p>
  This clustering of skyscrapers in the area can be traced back to its history
  as the residential lands of lords during the Edo period. Numerous such large
  estates in Tokyo were nationalized during the Meiji Restoration and were
  typically designated for parks, universities, railways, military, and other
  large institutions. Due to the single ownership of these plots and the absence
  of neighboring restrictions, portions of these lands, like Shinjuku West,
  Shiodome, and parts of Roppongi, have transformed into high-rise districts.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, in areas within Tokyo Bay, like Odaiba and Harumi, where land has
  been reclaimed from the sea, construction activities face fewer restrictions.
  This has given rise to numerous high-rise and more architecturally liberal
  buildings.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, Tokyo operates on a principle of minimal restriction. Where it is
  possible to avoid imposing limits, none are enforced. There is no substantial
  design control exerted over the city’s skyline. The cityscape evolves more
  organically, shaped by a mix of historical, communal, and practical
  considerations rather than by a grand, orchestrated design ethos.
</p>

<p><strong>Washington - Congress Controlled City</strong></p>

<p>
  In contrast to New York and Tokyo, authorities in the U.S. capital, Washington
  D.C., have effectively and broadly controlled architectural endeavors,
  imposing height limitations on buildings erected on private lands. These caps,
  varying from 27 to 39 meters depending on the location, render the buildings
  in the district relatively low-rise. Such restrictions, while preserving a
  certain aesthetic, have also imposed constraints on the district’s economic
  development. Nearly 20 global headquarters of Fortune 500 companies are
  located in the greater D.C. area, yet only two chose locations within the
  district; the rest sprawl across suburbs in Virginia and Maryland, resulting
  in a bustling business periphery surrounding a less vibrant capital center.
</p>

<p>
  This anomaly isn't solely attributed to the height restrictions but is also
  intertwined with regional fiscal policies and demographic structures.
  Nevertheless, the height cap is a striking reflection of the district's unique
  political ecosystem. Unlike other U.S. states, D.C. does not practice full
  local autonomy and democratic governance. It sends no senators to the U.S.
  Senate and its single representative in the House has no voting rights.
</p>

<p>
  The U.S. Congress has a dedicated committee overseeing the district’s affairs,
  but its members aren’t elected by D.C. residents. Prior to 1972, even the
  Mayor and governing body weren’t elected but appointed by the President.
  D.C.’s legal and governance structure, therefore, is not inherently
  democratic; it is tailored to serve the federal government, not necessarily
  the local populace.
</p>

<p>
  A popular notion suggests that D.C.’s height policy aims to accentuate the
  prominence of the Capitol’s dome, though there’s no concrete evidence to
  substantiate this claim. Credible sources propose that the restrictions
  originated in the late 19th century, concurrent with the advent of steel
  structures, borne out of concerns for fire safety and structural integrity.
  The reliability of steel was in question, and fire departments doubted their
  capability to manage blazes in buildings exceeding a certain height.
</p>

<p>
  While these reasons are documented, it provokes curiosity - didn’t other U.S.
  cities harbor similar apprehensions? Why didn’t a uniform policy emerge
  nationally?
</p>

<p>
  Two notable observations persist: 1) Objectively, D.C.’s height limitation
  facilitates the preservation of the visual prominence of the Capitol and other
  patriotic monuments; 2) D.C. is governed by Congress, not local autonomy.
  These factors contribute to the perpetuation of a European-style imperial city
  aesthetic, where federal monuments are accentuated. This unspoken motive
  underpins the enduring skyline control policy. Over time, this distinctive
  style has imbued D.C. with a unique urban environment that has garnered public
  affection and protection.
</p>

<p>
  Hence, I categorize D.C.’s skyline as one sculpted by deliberate design. From
  a design perspective, it holds its merits. However, as this lecture isn't
  focused on methodologies, we’ll not delve deeper into this aspect for now.
</p>

<p><strong>European Skylines - Diverse</strong></p>

<p>
  Those familiar with Washington D.C. may easily draw parallels between its city
  skyline and those of European cities. Indeed, many cities on the European
  continent lack an abundance of towering skyscrapers, often attributed to
  strict height restrictions. However, this is an oversimplification. Europe's
  political structure is notably decentralized and diverse; there is no
  uniformity in urban management or architectural policies. Each city's policy
  is independent of the others.
</p>

<p>
  The scarcity of ultra-tall buildings in Europe can primarily be examined from
  an economic perspective. From 1914 to 1945, Europe was engulfed in war and
  recession, with economies only beginning to recover in the 1950s. This period
  coincided with the first wave of skyscraper emergence globally. Europe,
  grappling with economic recovery, missed this architectural trend. When the
  European economy regained strength, the enthusiasm for skyscrapers had waned.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, the economic marginal benefit of ultra-tall buildings is negative
  in most parts of the world. They are characterized by high structural costs,
  lower space efficiency, lengthy construction periods, and substantial
  financial burdens, making them economically unfeasible in many areas.
</p>

<p>
  The aim of constructing tall buildings is often to achieve a high Floor Area
  Ratio (FAR) to optimize land use. However, achieving this doesn’t necessitate
  towering skyscrapers. As previously noted, with buildings around nine stories
  high, Washington D.C. has managed a FAR greater than 6 in many of its plots.
</p>

<p>
  Many European metropolises may have land prices exceeding a 1.5K USD per
  square meter, but the cost of building floor space remains relatively low,
  making the construction of skyscrapers economically unsound. It is estimated
  that a price of 7K USD per square meter (a very rough estimation) is a
  threshold for rational profit margins from skyscraper constructions—a scenario
  existing in hardly 1% of European cities, including London, Moscow, Paris,
  Milan, and Frankfurt, where ultra-tall business districts are evident.
</p>

<p>
  In contrast, cities like Munich, Barcelona, and Marseille often feature one or
  two conspicuous tall buildings, challenging the notion of a uniform,
  conservative architectural ethos in Europe. These ventures into high-rise
  constructions, however, haven’t established a commercially successful pattern
  or gained widespread cultural acceptance.
</p>

<p>
  During the 1950s-70s, Europe saw the rise of residential high-rises akin to
  today's Chinese residential communities—scattered tall buildings amidst green
  spaces, mostly social housing projects. These exist not only in former
  socialist countries of Eastern Europe but also extensively in Western Europe,
  particularly in France. However, these are often associated with stronger
  dependence on motor vehicles, higher energy consumption, and extensive land
  use—generally considered less economically and sustainably efficient.
</p>

<p>
  These constructions, embodying proactive urban design, significantly
  transformed the skylines of European suburban areas, reflecting ideological
  expressions. They epitomize a leftist European urban design, articulating an
  ideology of anti-authoritarianism and egalitarianism.
</p>

<p>
  Europe's skylines sometimes retain a touch of nature’s dominance. An iconic
  example is a prominent tree in Bath, UK, visible from kilometers away—a
  man-made landscape formed by an old and tall group of weeping willows on a
  260-year-old roundabout, reminiscent of the mythical World Tree.
</p>

<p>
  The diversity in the urban landscapes of European cities is undeniable. Their
  skylines, often expressive and orderly, encapsulate a conscious preservation
  of diversity akin to the preservation of ecological diversity. However,
  contrary to common perception, this isn’t always a result of deliberate
  preservation. A balance between preservation and freedom, without a uniform
  standard, represents the genuine pluralistic nature. No one accuses Europe of
  having uniform cities. In regions lacking top-down designs, uniformity is
  implausible.
</p>

<p><strong>Moscow - from Stalinistic Sisters to Oligarchic Towers</strong></p>

<p>
  Next, let’s turn our attention to Moscow. In the era of the Tsars, the city's
  skyline was dominated by the towers of the Kremlin and the steeples of
  numerous churches, a characteristic it shared with other major European
  cities.
</p>

<p>
  However, the Soviet era ushered in a new age and a demand for monuments
  emblematic of this period. Starting in 1922, the same year the Soviet Union
  was founded, a grand project began to take shape in Moscow. Originally
  intended as the headquarters for the Communist International, it was later
  envisioned as the main assembly hall for the Supreme Soviet, capable of
  accommodating twenty thousand representatives, and hence named the "Palace of
  the Soviets." The design competition for this project attracted left-leaning
  architects from around the globe, resulting in a plethora of avant-garde,
  modernist designs. However, due to prolonged development, by the time of
  Stalin in 1933, the selected design leaned towards a neo-classical, art-deco
  style. With a planned height of 400 meters, it would have been the tallest
  building in the world at the time. The project was not just ambitious in
  height, but also in its vast width. To make space for the Palace of the
  Soviets, in 1931, the Moscow authorities demolished the Cathedral of Christ
  the Saviour, a primary cathedral for the Russian Orthodox Church, standing 103
  meters tall - a decision rooted more in politics than architecture.
</p>

<p>
  The war interrupted the construction of the palace. Resources, including the
  steel originally earmarked for the building, were reallocated for war efforts.
  After the war, despite an influx of resources, interest in the project waned,
  and it was eventually abandoned after Stalin's death in 1952, with its
  foundations transformed into the world’s largest open-air swimming pool.
</p>

<p>
  During Stalin’s rule, however, seven skyscrapers famously known as the "Seven
  Sisters" were completed. These buildings, ranging in height from 134 to 240
  meters, occupied the skyline and were for a long time, the tallest in Europe.
  These landmarks, reminiscent of structures like the Beijing Exhibition Center
  and Shanghai Exhibition Center, exhibit a Russian Baroque and Gothic style,
  with their sharp spires shaping Moscow's skyline. These structures drew mixed
  reactions from Muscovites; while they are essential parts of the city’s
  architectural memory, they also represent an ideological and historical era
  that evokes complex emotions.
</p>

<p>
  In post-Soviet times, Moscow’s skyline underwent another transformation with
  the emergence of Moscow-City, a business district on the former industrial
  lands along the western ring road. This district, akin to Beijing's Guomao or
  Shanghai's Lujiazui, reflects the shifting power dynamics in Russian society.
  Since 2000, this business hub has witnessed the construction of more
  contemporary skyscrapers than either London or Frankfurt. The owners are
  primarily wealthy oligarchs from the energy sector and state-owned enterprises
  who flourished in the era of globalization. This cluster of buildings,
  voluminous in their structure, indicate a change in regime.
</p>

<p>
  The translation remains faithful to the detailed account of Moscow’s evolving
  skyline over various historical epochs while enhancing readability and flow
  for an English-speaking audience.
</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Skylines - Planned Chaos</strong></p>

<p>
  In this final section, I’d like to touch upon the evolution of China’s
  skyline.
</p>

<p>
  For a significant part of modern history, China lacked tall structures.
  Beijing, for example, largely retained its pre-modern skyline into the 20th
  century. The city's horizon was dominated by Buddhist pagodas dating back to
  the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, and structures like the White Pagoda at
  Beihai Park, the Dragon Pavilion on Jingshan, and the grand city walls and
  gates were prominent features. The silhouette of the Western Hills in the
  distance added a natural touch to the cityscape.
</p>

<p>
  High-rise buildings were rare until 1971 when a series of tall residential
  buildings were erected on the space left vacant by the demolished city walls
  and moat at Qian San Men. Known as the "Qian San Men Tower Blocks", these 9-12
  story buildings symbolized economic development and national prosperity at the
  time.
</p>

<p>
  In 1986, the 130-meter tall CCTV Tower on Fuxing Road, a significant beacon in
  the skyline, marked Beijing's only skyscraper. Its magical presence foretold a
  new era, and having a few such buildings was considered an honor. In contrast,
  a provincial city or county without any tall structures was seen as
  dishonorable.
</p>

<p>
  This scenario persisted until around 2008. Even in 2016, some property
  developers still viewed constructing skyscrapers as a contribution to the city
  that could earn them policy support. By then, the number of high-rises and
  skyscrapers in China had far exceeded those in the United States and the seven
  major Western industrialized nations combined.
</p>

<p>
  As skyscrapers became more commonplace and the nation’s poverty and
  inferiority complex alleviated, a backlash against tall buildings emerged.
  While skepticism and controversy surrounding high-rises have always existed
  worldwide, China began to introduce policies restricting their construction.
  This wasn't solely due to aesthetic preferences, structural safety, or fire
  safety considerations.
</p>

<p>
  At the core, the plethora of skyscrapers, backed by international economic
  entities and real estate and financial policy operating groups, represented
  the materialization of their financial and political ascent and carried a
  semblance of Western ideological influence. It became unsettling for many when
  these towering structures dominated the skyline.
</p>

<p>
  Height restrictions in architecture became a means for administrative
  authorities to exert control, often involving multi-departmental
  collaboration. The widespread urban planning rule that capped residential
  buildings at 100 meters was known to many. A sea of uniform 100-meter tall
  buildings, a byproduct of two decades of explosive economic growth and height
  restrictions, dotted many city skylines.
</p>

<p>
  In the context of a robust economy and technology, a population boom, and high
  land values, these 100-meter buildings, initially symbols of modern urban
  life, became commonplace due to the enormous output of Chinese builders,
  making them the most affordable housing option—a phenomenon akin to a world
  miracle.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, the 100-meter height cap has been reduced to 80 meters—a natural
  outcome of the growing disdain for high-rise residences. This specific number,
  a compromise between a too lenient 15% reduction and a too harsh 30% cut, is a
  testament to the art of policy-making in the administrative landscape.
</p>

<p>
  That concludes my introduction to Skyline. Later, I will try to explain some
  urban phenomena from the perspective of morphology.
</p>
