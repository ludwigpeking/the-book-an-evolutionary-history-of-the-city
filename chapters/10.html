<h1>10 By Men and their Mules, Routes being an Evolutionary System</h1>
<p>(Edited by the Author on July 24, 2023)</p>

<p>
  In this chapter, we transition from discussing hydrology to examining the
  importance of trade routes. What significance does trade hold in the fabric of
  society? There exists a perception that trade does not generate value, but
  merely shifts goods from one individual to another. But is this truly the
  case? Permit me to deliver the response succinctly: no, it is not. Trade is
  not just a simple exchange; it indeed produces substantial value. As a student
  of economics, I can elucidate. The immense value rendered by commerce resides
  in the division of labor it facilitates. This division allows each individual
  to leverage their comparative advantage and pool the skills and abilities of a
  diverse group. For now, I will not delve into the specifics. Much of this
  material overlaps with content covered elsewhere, such as Xue Zhaofeng's
  economics class explanation of the "Principle of Comparative Advantage", which
  is notably comprehensive. Commerce serves as a pivotal force driving the
  ascent and descent of civilizations. City road systems and those beyond urban
  boundaries can be categorized as infrastructure. Understand infrastructure as
  constructs put in place specifically to diminish the costs associated with
  commercial transactions.
</p>

<p><strong>Elements of the City for Trading</strong></p>

<p>
  Within cities, as we've previously discussed, temples functioned as the
  earliest credit institutions. They issued currency and stored commodities.
</p>

<p>
  Warehouses played a crucial role. In barter transactions, they simply had to
  change the ownership records of the goods in the warehouse to complete the
  transaction. There was no need for physical movement of the commodities.
</p>

<p>
  Markets served as centralized trading locations. They facilitated the
  accumulation of commercial credibility and prestige for each trader. Repeated
  transactions among regular trading counterparts fostered trust, thus reducing
  the risk and costs of their transactions.
</p>

<p>
  Noble warriors provided protection for market transactions and sometimes
  served as arbiters for commercial disputes.
</p>

<p>
  Transactions without such protection and arbitration incurred incredibly high
  costs. Without enforcers of order, as I noted in the 77th issue of the
  podcast, merchants could become thieves at any moment.
</p>

<p>
  Road infrastructure was designed to lower transportation costs, enabling
  transport activities to consume as little time, effort, and resources as
  possible.
</p>

<p><strong>Routes</strong></p>

<p>In this episode, I'll mainly discuss terrestrial trade routes.</p>

<p>
  If you observe the ancient trade routes on the map, regardless of the patterns
  within the city, whether they be grid-like or more complex, beyond the city
  limits, they generally radiate outwards. Each radial road connects two main
  destinations on the map. The age of these destinations hints at the age of the
  roads between them and vice versa. These radiating lines are by no means
  straight. They are not any easily understandable type of arc either. They
  combine elements of straightness, curvature, and slight swaying, forming a
  very ambiguous shape. If you have a foundation in analytical geometry, you'll
  find these lines are almost impossible to describe with equations. As an
  architect, I can tell you these shapes are the least preferred by architects.
  They seem to fall short of classical beauty, or you could say they seem
  lacking rationality.
</p>

<p>
  However, roads are essentially an evolved system. People will travel various
  routes, and over time some of these become relatively fixed. Others are
  overgrown with wild grass and no longer in use. The great Le Corbusier once
  quipped that the winding shape of the road was carved out by mules. This isn't
  a direct quote, but the idea is: mules always head in the least strenuous
  direction, bypassing steep slopes and rocks. Humans, on the other hand, walk
  straight because they have a clear direction.
</p>

<p>
  His attitude towards the shape of roads is somewhat sarcastic. But what he
  mocks is precisely the essence of the evolutionary system. On the road, humans
  and mules walk together. Humans guide the direction, but mules are also
  crucial as they carry goods. Humans have a purpose; they know which direction
  to go, while mules prefer the path of least resistance. They don't like going
  up and down hills and prefer to walk along contours. On the grand scale,
  humans guide mules, but they can't constantly control them, as it would be too
  tiring. They mostly follow the mules' preference, correcting the direction
  only when there's a deviation. Thus, the path of the road is the weighted path
  integral of human and mule will at each instant.
</p>

<p>
  Indeed, humans aren't necessarily rational either. There's a saying that the
  relationship between human consciousness and the subconscious is like a rider
  and an elephant. The subconscious can be trained by consciousness to a certain
  extent, but it may be much stronger than the conscious mind. In other words,
  at this level, humans are a fusion of rationality and animal instincts.
</p>

<p>
  A caravan's route may not be rational or necessarily the most efficient. It
  doesn't need to be rational. They simply add an option to the system of trade
  routes. Among many routes, over time, the one that is most familiar and
  relatively efficient will prevail, becoming the main trade route. It might not
  even be the most efficient one, but it certainly is relatively efficient. And
  it is much more likely to be more efficient than a straight route designed by
  humans.
</p>

<p>
  The straight routes that Le Corbusier believes are dictated by human will are
  often less efficient. If I were to travel from Shanghai to Nanjing along a
  straight line, it would pass over Yangcheng Lake, cross over the Purple
  Mountain, which would be quite costly. Also, it would only pass through
  Kunshan and Wuxi but miss important destinations like Suzhou, Changzhou, and
  Zhenjiang. The probability of my going to Suzhou from Shanghai isn't
  necessarily lower than going to Nanjing. Moreover, there are far more
  destinations along this route. Therefore, actual roads twist and turn,
  avoiding various natural obstacles. They lead to places where bridges already
  exist, places with important resources, and towns with many consumers.
</p>

<p>
  This kind of efficiency is complex and difficult to fully assess with
  arbitrary human design.
</p>

<p>
  As a result of evolution, these winding and shaking roads may be attracted by
  a certain well, may lean towards a stone-producing mine, or may be due to any
  reason you can or cannot identify.
</p>

<p>
  In Beijing, the Chaoyangmen Outer Street, the Xizhimen Outer Street, and the
  Beiyuan Road outside Anzhenmen, which I am quite familiar with, are all
  traditional roads of this shape. They are straight within the city gates, and
  once they leave the city, they twist and turn towards their destination.
</p>

<p>
  In London, Holborn Street, one of the main roads leading out from the
  northwest gate of the ancient Roman city of London, likely has a history of
  around 2000 years.
</p>

<p>
  New York's Broadway is a road walked by the natives, older than the history of
  New York City itself.
</p>

<p>
  These roads still often serve as the main streets of these cities today. They
  all have that ambiguous, winding direction.
</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
  The word "old" is mentioned here. Being old in itself holds no special value;
  it merely refers to something that has experienced a lengthy history. It may
  have endured many environmental changes and various challenges. If it still
  possesses vitality, it demonstrates the great adaptability inherent within it,
  indicating that it is a survivor of stringent selection.
</p>

<p>
  All roads lead to Rome. According to Fairgrieve, a writer on geography and
  global hegemony:
</p>

<p>
  If you observe the topography of the Italian Peninsula carefully, you will
  notice that the Apennine Mountains form an arch. The arc's convexity, to the
  right, presses the eastern side of the peninsula, making it steep and narrow,
  rendering north-south land travel on the peninsula's eastern coast quite
  difficult. The western hilly area is comparatively expansive. From the north,
  traffic from the densely populated Po River Plain heading south generally cuts
  diagonally across the Apennines. Regardless of the pass you take, you have a
  high probability of progressing along the valley areas of the Arno or Tiber
  rivers. These valleys are winding, but they are the flattest. Heading south
  along the Tiber River, you will arrive in Rome. This road system is the result
  of evolution, one of which is the Via Cassia, one of the Roman roads.

<p>
  In classical times, the most developed Greek city-states in southern Italy
  were Brindisi and Taranto, located in the heel of Italy's boot shape. From
  there, entering the hilly area of Central Italy, you would follow the winding
  roads between the hills of Campania and eventually pass through Rome. The
  outcome of this system's evolution is the Appian Way.
</p>

<p>
  In this sense, you will find that Rome's location itself is the result of road
  evolution. Thus, the rise of this small village to a great nation is not
  solely reliant on the courage and wisdom of its successive kings and consuls.
  The geographical location likely played a crucial role.
</p>

<p>
  After Rome became a great power, Rome was the starting point of several major
  roads, creating the situation where all roads lead to Rome. This situation can
  be said to be a result of human engineering, affirming the results of mule
  behavior. They followed historical trade routes and developed in the direction
  of the smoothest terrain.
</p>

<p>
  The construction of Roman roads was a resource-consuming process. However,
  these high-quality roads, which prevented road water accumulation and reduced
  vehicular bounce, saved travel time and physical exertion, ultimately saving
  energy and playing a productive role. The essence of infrastructure is to save
  the energy consumed in transportation and trade. Once the trade route becomes
  relatively stable, it will form network effects and path dependence in
  economics.
</p>

<p>
  That is, everyone takes this road, and its value increases. Roads promote
  urban development, and the city will in turn consolidate the value of its
  trade routes.
</p>

<p>Both of these relationships exist simultaneously.</p>

<p>
  A city not on the main trade route will not grow. However, at the intersection
  of important trade routes, a city is likely to grow.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, the rise and replacement of water transport tools, leading to the
  rise and fall of different trade routes, is also a major reason for the rise
  and fall of cities.
</p>

<p>
  Here I mentioned the "intersection of trade routes". Trade routes are so long
  that any point on them is not easily distinguished from other points. Only
  those intersections of trade routes, whose advantages are very apparent, are
  almost a guarantee of urban prosperity. Major world cities are almost always
  associated with the intersection of trade routes.
</p>

<p>
  I previously discussed Beijing in issue 44. It is located at the intersection
  of the major roads at the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, the major roads
  at the foothills of the Yan Mountains, and the two major roads leading to the
  regions beyond the Great Wall. I won't repeat that today.
</p>

<p>
  In the next issue, I will talk about a few of Europe's grand imperial cities,
  London, Paris, and Kyoto.
