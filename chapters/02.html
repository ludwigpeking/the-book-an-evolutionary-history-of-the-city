<h1>02 An Origin of the City, a Holy Site for Community Making</h1>
<p></p>

<p>
  In this chapter, I will explore the origin of cities, starting with the first
  aspect: their role in the formation of community.
</p>

<p><strong>From band to clan </strong></p>

<p>
  Community is essential because it is impossible for an individual to survive
  alone. A man armed with a bow and arrow or a spear could not guarantee success
  in hunting a wild boar. But archaeological evidence suggests that primitive
  humans were able to hunt mammoths. It is clear that this was not the work of a
  single individual.
</p>

<p>
  In modern times, there are still hunter-gatherer communities living on the
  grasslands of East Africa. It only needs a small team of three to defeat a
  lion, relying on their intelligence and cooperation.
</p>

<p>
  And this three-person team belongs to a community with tacit cooperation and
  mutual trust. This community is the basic unit for their survival. and it is
  through this unit that humans are able to maintain their position at the top
  of the food chain.
</p>

<p>
  The population of small Paleolithic bands typically ranged from 20 to 100
  individuals. It is related to the ecological concept of land carrying
  capacity, which places limits on the size of a community that can be sustained
  by a reachable area of land.
</p>

<p><strong>The low density of Paleolithic population</strong></p>

<p>
  To provide an example, the Yellowstone National Park, located in the United
  States, spans approximately 9,000 square kilometers of land.
</p>

<p>
  The park is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including over 30,000 elk,
  which translates to more than three elk per square kilometer. The park also
  has approximately 4,000 yaks, with an average of one yak per two square
  kilometers. In contrast, the park's population of brown bears and wolves is
  much smaller, with only 300 of each species. This means that there is only
  enough prey to support one predator for every 30 square kilometers. Despite
  these predator populations, Humans are far more lethal than wolves, so the
  number of land carrying people may not necessarily be more than wolves.
</p>

<p>________________________________________________________________</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  It took a vast land of a few square kilometers to feed a single
  hunter-gathers, and a tribe's hunting and gathering range on foot typically
  covers only a few hundred square kilometers.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  These tribes are typically composed of families with close kinship ties, which
  are instinctual and form natural communities. This is the natural community of
  people. The border of the natural community is the people you are born into
  and are intuitively protecting. This kind of community has existed since
  ancient times.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to competing with wild beasts, small communities must also compete
  with other communities. This competition can be peaceful or violent. It
  evolves a lot of competitive strategies.
</p>

<p>
  One of the most important strategies is cemetery identification. A community
  that respects its ancestors and maintains their tombs and tombstones is more
  likely to thrive. Families that identify with the same ancestors and patronize
  the same cemeteries can recognize and unite with one another, giving them a
  competitive advantage.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  Even if a tribe wants to join another more powerful tribe, its leader can also
  invent other people's cemetery as their cemetery. If it happens that they do
  not have a well-known cemetery, it will be more convenient.
</p>

<p>
  Conversely, if a tribe with a cemetery wants to annex another tribe, they can
  also share the identify their cemetery with others. This manipulation of facts
  can be done easily and quickly, making cemetery identification a powerful tool
  for uniting communities. As it only takes a generation for the propaganda
  department to turn any myth into fact.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, the cemetery is a tool of united front and also a tool of national
  invention. Any tribe with a cemetery can form a union between small
  communities to form a virtual larger community. The cemetery recognized by the
  large community is a holy place and a physical evidence of myths in the world.
</p>

<p>
  A long-standing holy place must meet certain conditions, such as avoiding
  mudslides and landslides that could make tombstones disappear and ensuring
  that floods do not accumulate silt that covers the original surface marks.
  While not all ancient people knew how to choose such a location, the right
  choice can provide a powerful tool for a united front, while the wrong choice
  can lead to the loss of this tool. This is a process of natural selection in
  evolution.

<p>
  You can find that sites with good sanctuary conditions may also be suitable
  for settlements if they have a steady supply of water and food.
</p>

<p>
  divine siting, as a technique of making union, has achieved universal victory,
  become more mature and produced many variants. It doesn't matter whether it is
  a cemetery; Different types of worship, including totem worship and animal
  worship, can be practiced at these sites, making them flexible and changeable.
</p>

<p>
  Small communities use sacred sites to identify themselves and organize into
  larger ones. More mature large communities evolve into nations, with the
  nation becoming the basic unit of competition. This has been a major theme
  throughout recorded human history on a large scale.
</p>

<p>
  Sacred sites represent the physical manifestation of a large community. People
  repeatedly visit these sites, and professional religious leaders are
  responsible for providing organization and services to worshipers. These
  leaders may have been the earliest urban settlers. Interestingly, before the
  French Revolution, the Estates-General consisted of three estates or
  professions, with religious leaders ranked first, even before the nobility. In
  India's caste system, the highest caste is the Brahmins, who are priests, and
  not even the king ranks higher; the king and warriors are the second caste
  known as Kshatriyas. The role of religious leaders in the formation of large
  communities is therefore critical. They play a primary role in maintaining
  stability, and their work is the lowest-cost solution ( compared to violence )
  to social issues. In modern atheist countries, religious leaders are sometimes
  replaced by revolutionary leaders or propaganda departments. Religious leaders
  and monuments form the physical and ideological foundations of sacred sites
  and are typically found at the heart of a city.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  The exchange of goods and services among worshippers creates an efficient
  marketplace at the holy site. We oversee a temporary market known as a temple
  fair, which takes place on specific religious festival days when all citizens
  come to worship. These distinct structures help shape the outline of the city.
</p>

<p>
  Large cities with political significance all have a monument or holy site that
  serves as a symbol for the larger community. The more developed the physical
  structure of the holy site, the more it signifies the existence of
  organization.
</p>

<p>The holy sites take different forms in the different context.</p>

<p><strong>Tomb</strong>s</p>

<p>
  The tallest and largest building in the ancient world was the Great Pyramid of
  Giza, Egypt, 4,600 years ago. Needless to say, it is
  <strong>the tomb</strong> of the Egyptian kings.
</p>

<p><strong>Temple</strong>s</p>

<p>
  Thebes, the capital of ancient Egypt, has no living buildings left today, but
  the huge <strong>obelisks</strong> and stone pillars of the Karnak
  <strong>Temple</strong> and Luxor Temple are still standing after 3,500 years.
</p>

<p>
  Jerusalem, one of the things people are most familiar with is probably the
  Wailing Wall, the Western Wall of the ancient Jewish temple. The sanctuary is
  gone today, replaced by the Dome of the Rock, also a religious shrine.
</p>

<p>
  On the Capitoline Hill in Rome is his Temple of Jupiter, which the ancient
  Romans would defend to the last, the real center of their city-state
  community.
</p>

<p>Similarly, on the Acropolis of Athens is his Parthenon;</p>

<p><strong>Shrines to Their Leaders</strong></p>

<p>
  On the central axis of Washington, there are the Capitol, the Washington
  Monument, the temples of Lincoln and Jefferson;
</p>

<p>
  In the center of Beijing are the Monument to the People's Heroes and Mao
  Zedong's Memorial Hall;
</p>

<p><strong>Governmental Buildings/Open Space</strong></p>

<p>
  In the center of Bucharest, the capital of Romania, stands the People's
  Palace, a monumental building built by Ceausescu, an old friend of the Chinese
  people. This is the latest of the monuments I mentioned above. To build this
  building As well as the public space around him, a total of 7 square
  kilometers of the old city were demolished. This building is also the heaviest
  single building in the world, with a weight of 4.1 million tons.
</p>

<p><strong>A Sign of the Strength of Organization</strong></p>

<p>
  Monuments serve as an expression of the values, aspirations, and cultural
  heritage of communities. While traditional temples and monuments remain
  popular forms, modern communities exhibit a range of monument styles, from
  buildings and streets to intangible objects.
</p>

<p>
  In larger cities, grand monuments reflect the community's historically strong
  organizational abilities. For example, within a 100-kilometer radius of
  northern France, over a dozen Gothic cathedrals from the 12th to the 13th
  centuries, such as Saint-Denis, Rouen, Chartres, and Amiens, stand as a
  testament to the region's financial and technical strength and fierce
  competition among cities.
</p>

<p>
  The majesty and development of European community churches reflect their
  communities' strong organizational power, as well as their position as
  significant political and economic centers. On the other hand, communities
  that lack such organizational power are unlikely to produce grand monuments,
  and any ancient traces may be sold off, indicating a community in decline.
</p>

<p>
  In essence, monuments serve as a reflection of the community's identity and
  values, and their styles and forms evolve with the changing needs and
  aspirations of communities over time.
