<h1>
  07 City as the Hardware of Organization - a summary of previous chapters 
</h1>
<p>Summarize the previous chapters.</p>

<p>
  1) The natural unit for people to participate in the struggle for survival is
  not the individual, but their <strong>band</strong> of kinship. It can be
  extended to all identifiable relatives by blood. Its typical size is thirty to
  fifty people.
</p>

<p>
  2) These families have their ups and downs, and one of the elements is the
  ancestral grave. bands with a common ancestral graves are easier to form
  identification with each other. A union of multiple bands is formed through
  the institution of shrine dedicated to common ancestry, that is,<strong>
    a tribe</strong
  >.
</p>

<p>
  3) In addition to common shrine, other religious beliefs can also form a
  larger community of people. These larger communities, alliances of tribes, or
  <strong>city states</strong>, gradually became the main entities of the
  competition in human society. Therefore, places of worship are the initial
  hardware for the formation of cities. Cities are formed to organize people.

  4) <strong>A sanctuary's function</strong> is more than religion itself.
  Generally, a temple often serves the functions of,
</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 can easily be used as a warehouse and a treasury;</li>

  <li>2 As a bank, grant relief or profit-making loans;</li>

  <li>
    3 The crowds gathered in the temple make the front of the temple the best
    location for a marketplace. Since ancient times, the temple and the market
    have been linked together—the so-called temple fair;
  </li>

  <li>
    4 A temple, because it contains important property and holy relics, is also
    often a fortified stronghold, and it is a refuge for the followers in times
    of war;
  </li>

  <li>
    5 The priests of the temple are also the earliest writers, astronomers and
    mathematians, so the temple is often a research and educational institution
    for writing, astronomy and mathematics;
  </li>

  <li>
    6 The knowledge of astronomy and mathematics of the priestly class made them
    the earliest experts in irrigation and experts in dividing and measuring
    farmland.
  </li>

  <li>
    7 Priests can conduct judicial decisions through fortune-telling or
    theological interpretation. So the temple is often a kind of court.
  </li>

  <li>8 A decision-making body for war and policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In short, sanctuary has great significance for the development of society.
  Having mature and multifunctional religious sites is an important symbol that
  distinguishes cities from villages. Religious places, in order to strengthen
  their authority, erect monumental buildings and objects.
</p>

<p>
  5) The development of religious holy places is one aspect, and the other
  aspect, <strong>the agricultural revolution</strong>, is also very important,
  which is the invention of agriculture and animal husbandry. Among them, the
  agricultural way of life can support a particularly large population density,
  a part of which can be separated from food production, specialize themselves
  in religious activities or the construction of monuments. The construction of
  monuments was a major mode of competition among the different tribes and
  city-states. Therefore, the agricultural revolution and the vast farmland are
  also the basis for the rise of urban civilization.
</p>

<p>
  6) Farmers who enter the agricultural lifestyle often produce sizable
  production surplus. Their way of survival is relatively stable and does not
  participate in fierce competition. In a world of Bronze Age or Iron Age, with
  escalating violence in wars, the political power of most of the farmers was
  left behind. Farmers turned into peasants in the society was equivalent to the
  most downstream producer in the food chain, falling into the role of pure
  resource contributor. As a result, warriors, often hunters and herdsmen,
  appeared, forming a division of labor with the agricultural population and
  becoming the protectors of the peasants. The warriors and heros, are the
  origin of the king. They are both protectors and oppressors of the peasants.
  However, this symbiotic relationship between the two forms
  <strong>a symbiont</strong> that constitutes a complete biome at the dawn of
  the city.
</p>

<p>
  Evolution is done under the pressure of competition. Under such pressure, one
  loses his/her "natural status', is forced to be integrated into a more complex
  organization and order, into the operation of the community machine, heavy
  agricultural labor and organized violence against one's own kind, to oppress
  and be oppressed. These actions made the city what it is,
  <strong>a new species of multicellular organism</strong>, or one may say, a
  physical container of complex orders.
</p>

<p>
  Analog can be made that the ruler is like the nervous system of the human
  body. The brain lives in the meninges and is isolated from the blood to
  prevent the invasion of daily bacteria and viruses. In this way, brain cells
  can live a long life, which is equal to the human life span. Similarly, the
  rulers live in the Citadel, the central castle of a city, separated from the
  common people by tall walls. The fall of the Citadel of the city means the
  brain death of a city state, loss of functionality, and the demise of the
  city-state.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, the defense of a city is usually a Russian nesting doll-like
  structure, layer after layers. The more in the middle, the higher it is, the
  more difficult it is to conquer. Fighting from the outside, the invaders have
  to jump over layers of death traps. But hitting from the inside out is
  straight forward. Therefore, the outermost circle of the city wall, normally
  of the downtown, is not only a city to protect the commoners, but also a
  concentration camp for the commoners, a security util.
</p>

<p>
  7) In some cases, the roles of<strong> king and priest</strong> were
  intertwined, particularly when religious practices were relatively simple and
  did not require high levels of professional expertise. However, in more
  complex religious systems, the roles of kings and priests, those who
  maintained both political and religious order, often became distinct
  professions. It was common for kings and priests to depend on each other while
  also engaging in power struggles. In reality, they needed to take turns
  playing leading roles in different situations, forming a collaborative
  relationship. City-states with better coordination exhibited richer
  organizational patterns, while those that achieved lower-cost or more
  effective ways to maintain order had a greater chance of survival.
</p>

<p>
  8) Whether theocracy or kingship held dominant positions were
  <strong>manifested</strong> <strong>in the city</strong> as the inner city,
  the acropolis, or the citadel. What are in the citadel? Typically, it housed
  the royal palace, temple, and granary simultaneously. In some cases, the high
  priest also assumed responsibilities in warfare and jurisdiction.
  Occasionally, the king also served as a priest. In republics, there were only
  priests without kings, the temple often occupies the primary location in the
  citadel. Whereas for some European princes, who served the distant Catholic
  Church in Rome, often had castle that primarily taken by the royal palace,
  with the chapel in a secondary position.
</p>

<p>
  In this series so far, still many important patterns have not appeared. In my
  next chapters, I will talk about the role of trade and natural resources in
  urban evolution. Of course, their importance in the formation of order is not
  less than that of religions and forces.
