  In this section, we will explore another perspective on urban morphology, one
  that doesn’t hinge heavily on complex theories but is rather intuitive.
</p>

<p><strong>Classical and Venecular</strong></p>

<p>
  We can broadly categorize the buildings within a city into two groups through
  a straightforward observation. The first category encompasses majestic,
  authoritative buildings adorned with cultural symbols; examples include the
  Tiananmen Gate Tower, the Hall of Prayer in the Temple of Heaven, and the
  People's Congress Building in Beijing, as well as St. Paul’s Cathedral and the
  Westminster Palace in London.
</p>

<p>
  The second category consists of more humble, pragmatic structures designed
  primarily for functionality. Examples of this type include the cave dwellings
  in Shaanxi, stilt houses in Hunan, fishing villages along the Ligurian coast,
  various courtyard houses worldwide, the industrial buildings in Beijing’s 798
  Art Zone, residential areas in Fangzhuang and the Asian Games Village,
  warehouses along the Chicago River, and residential complexes in Hachioji,
  Tokyo. We can also extend this category to include more temporary structures,
  such as the tent stalls at festivals around the world.
</p>

<p>
  I refer to the first, more grandiose category as "classical architecture" and
  the second, more practical type as "vernacular architecture." The method of
  observing a city that I’m introducing involves analyzing its history, social
  structure, and wealth level based on the proportion of these two types of
  architecture present.
</p>

<p>
  It might be noted that my use of the terms "classical" and "vernacular"
  architecture may not align with their conventional definitions. Indeed, my
  discourse extends from the works of Luxembourg architect Leon Krier. I have
  adopted his terminology - ‘Classical Architecture’ and ‘Vernacular
  Architecture’ - and generalized their definitions to cover a broader timespan
  in the city's evolutionary history, making these concepts applicable to the
  analysis of contemporary architecture.
</p>

<p>
  Through this lens, the proportion and presence of these two architectural
  styles within a city can offer profound insights into the city’s historical
  progression, social stratification, and economic status. This dual-category
  perspective presents a simplified yet insightful lens for assessing urban
  development and the underlying forces that shape it.
</p>

<p>
  Classical architecture in a narrower sense, denotes structures reminiscent of
  ancient temples, halls, and monuments. However, from a morphological
  perspective, the essence of classical architecture lies in its conceptual
  nature. It is crafted to flaunt the prestige of its owners and augment their
  authority. Thus, classical buildings are not confined to ancient times.
  Consequently, the opposite of classical architecture isn't modern or
  contemporary architecture but rather vernacular architecture.
</p>

<p>
  Vernacular architecture in a narrower sense, refers to the indigenous and
  native building styles of a particular region. Think of wooden structured
  homes in Swiss villages or the cave dwellings on the Loess Plateau. These
  structures are characterized by their use of local materials and their
  adaptability to the regional climate – temperature, sunlight, precipitation –
  built by local craftsmen, exuding an air of practicality and simplicity. When
  we expand the definition of vernacular architecture, it transcends rural
  constructions and encapsulates straightforward, utility-driven urban
  structures like average homes, factories, warehouses, and shops. These
  structures, unconcerned with prestige or authority and unaimed at promoting
  specific cultural or conceptual narratives, embody the spirit of vernacular
  architecture. (Indeed, vernacular buildings are a treasure trove in
  architectural studies.) Even the modern, technologically intensive, and
  refined high-rise residences at the mouth of the Sumida River in Tokyo are
  built on principles of cost-efficiency and functionality without attempting to
  convey conceptual significances. Thus, morphologically, they share a
  structural homology with pre-industrial vernacular architecture.
</p>

<p>
  In this context, we have laid out the morphological definitions of classical
  and vernacular architectures.
</p>

<p>
  This series has consistently explored the three primary forces shaping cities:
  defense, economy, and ideology. The defensive aspect, prioritizing the
  protection of life and property rights, is exemplified in structures like city
  walls, enclosures, fortresses, and security systems. We'll set aside this
  foundational element for now. The remaining two cornerstones, economy and
  ideology, are embodied in vernacular and classical architecture, respectively.
</p>

<p><strong>the Proportion in History</strong></p>

<p>
  Looking back through history, vernacular architecture predates its classical
  counterpart, a testament to its pervasive presence since antiquity. In the
  initial stages of human civilization, when survival was a grueling task,
  economic surplus for architectural embellishment and ostentation was scarce.
</p>

<p>
  Materials employed in construction were typically sourced from the immediate
  environment. Tree bark was processed into ropes and used for roofing to offer
  waterproofing, branches were crafted into beams, pillars, rafters, and
  purlins, and mud was used as filler or shaped into adobe bricks. The
  architectural sophistication at this stage was rudimentary, akin to the humble
  straw house of the first little pig in the classic tale.
</p>

<p>
  In this scenario, architectural manifestations are primary, driven by the
  direct need for shelter and security, absent of elaborate aesthetic or
  symbolic concerns. The built environment emerges as a direct response to
  immediate, tangible needs, with no room for the luxury of conceptual or
  aesthetic embellishments.
</p>

<p>
  The earliest human groups, or Bands, consisted of a dozen or at most, a few
  dozens who were related by blood. There were essentially no outsiders to whom
  wealth could be flaunted. However, as these small kin groups coalesced into
  tribes, there emerged a need for leadership to unify actions and consolidate
  power, necessitating elements that signified order and hierarchy. In the midst
  of early settlements constructed of the first little pig’s caliber of houses,
  order spontaneously manifested in the form of larger dwellings for elders and
  the emergence of shrines.
</p>

<p>
  The chief’s thatched home would often feature decorated roofs and eaves.
  Sometimes, it was intentionally built taller or placed on an elevated
  platform. The entrance gate would often be grand and imposing. Inside the
  chief's large house, mysterious or valuable items would be displayed. Shrines
  would receive similar treatment. The seer would often live in seclusion to
  minimize exposing his or her human facets. The seer’s house would often be
  encased within a square courtyard, with strict restrictions on the entry of
  ordinary people.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond the architecture of the living, there were structures for the deceased,
  or for divine beings; totem poles or cairns expressed a collective myth of a
  people. This marked the inception of what would evolve into classical
  architecture. Even much later, the golden tents of the Great Khan of Mongolia,
  or some wooden churches in Northern Europe, largely remained at this stage.
</p>

<p>
  Monumental structures like the pyramids or the Karnak Temple constructed in
  ancient Egypt, despite enduring thousands of years of weathering, have stood
  the test of time.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, the most enduring and widespread influence in classical architecture can
  be traced back to the forms left by the ancient Greeks and Romans from the 5th
  century BC to the 5th century AD.
</p>

<p>
  Initially, the temples of ancient Greece resembled the second little pig’s
  wooden structure – a phase that left behind no lasting structures. However, by
  the 5th century BC, the Greeks had entered the “third little pig” phase,
  constructing a plethora of temples primarily from stone, elevating the
  prestige and durability of this architectural form. This style of classical
  architecture, coupled with Greek knowledge and technology, was widely emulated
  throughout Western Europe and the Mediterranean and reached as far as Central
  Asia and Britain.
</p>

<p>
  During its proliferation, constant innovations were introduced, especially by
  the ancient Romans, who incorporated the arch and dome techniques in brick and
  stone construction. Buildings grew taller, spans wider, and spaces more
  expansive. New materials like red brick, hollow bricks, and concrete were
  employed, giving rise to a plethora of classical architectural types. These
  included, but were not limited to, temples, theaters, council halls, arenas,
  race tracks, palaces, tower structures, and bath centers - a comprehensive
  suite of public edifices that formed the archetype of classical architecture
  in the narrow sense.
</p>

<p>
  These archetypes were widely replicated over an extensive period across a
  significant portion of the world.
</p>

<p>
  This marked a global homage to, and identification with, the philosophical,
  scientific, and political ideals of the Greco-Roman classical world within the
  Western hemisphere and its influenced regions.
</p>

<p>
  As Western civilization spread its influence through globalization,
  architectural practices worldwide felt its impact. In China, a phenomenon
  emerged, evidenced by the so-called "County Town White House" and similar
  structures in villages and towns. (<em
    >*"County Town White House" refers to a phenomenon in China where local
    administrative buildings, often in smaller cities and towns, are constructed
    in a grand, Western classical architectural style reminiscent of the Capitol
    in Washington, D.C., as the public misidentify the Capitol with the White
    House.)
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  Japan and South Korea, too, saw the rise of highly Western classical
  architectural examples, evident in structures like their national assembly
  buildings.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, every culture steeped in robust traditions boasts its distinct classic
  architectural styles. The domes of mosques, the onion domes of Orthodox
  churches, and the grand roofs characteristic of traditional Chinese
  architecture, each echo the rich cultural heritage from which they arise.
</p>

<p>
  Vernacular architecture, however, is less a reflection of cultural
  inclinations and more an adaptation to the available materials and climatic
  conditions of a particular location. The stone-walled residences of Taihang
  Mountains share more similarities with those atop Laoshan Mountains than with
  the adobe brick homes nestled at the foot of Taihang. In another hemisphere,
  the gassho-zukuri farmhouses of Japan’s Shirakawa-go mirror the architectural
  essence of Swiss homes, yet diverge starkly from the residences sprawling
  across the Nobi Plain below.
</p>

<p><strong>the Mosaic</strong></p>

<p>
  In the mosaic of a city’s architecture, the pattern formed by the intertwining
  of classical and vernacular buildings unveils distinct identities.
</p>

<p><strong>1) All Vernacular</strong></p>

<p>
  A common assumption often leads us to believe that rural areas are bastions of
  vernacular architecture, every structure a testament to simplicity and
  functionality. However, the reality of a 100% vernacular landscape is
  peculiar, if not uncanny.
</p>

<p>
  Nature abhors a vacuum and also despises utter flatness in structure. A
  biological community devoid of a food chain is unfathomable. In the same vein,
  a universe composed solely of hydrogen atoms, due to gravity, will inevitably
  birth disparities in density. These higher density pockets trigger nuclear
  reactions, begetting a diversity of atoms and complex chemical structures.
</p>

<p>
  Villages, products of evolutionary processes, are not homogenous entities. The
  anomaly of uniform villages is often the offspring of human planning. One
  might observe this in the military barracks of the Ming dynasty or in some of
  the newly constructed rural areas in Northern China, where each household is
  allocated an identical courtyard and house. This artificial, granular society
  is an aberration from the natural order, likened by philosophers to a basket
  of potatoes or a stretch of sandy soil.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, even in this engineered uniformity, diversity seeks its expression.
  Absent the heavy hand of external enforcement, the building behaviours of
  individual households introduce an element of non-uniformity. Some expand
  their homes to two stories, others adorn their facades with ornately patterned
  ceramic tiles, and yet others crown their roofs with gourd-shaped spires.
  Hence, while the village retains a level of pronounced homogeneity, elements
  of conceptuality and endeavours towards classicism subtly permeate the
  landscape.
</p>

<p><strong>2) Predominantly Vernacular</strong></p>

<p>
  A more commonplace scenario mirrors the villages in Shanxi, where the bulk of
  the architecture is modest and utilitarian, akin to the quadrangle dwellings
  typical of vernacular design. Yet, complexity emerges: the main houses of
  affluent families boast opulent decorations, and within the village's
  confines, ancestral halls or temples of classic design stand as silent
  sentinels, bearing testimonies and transmitting ideologies. Occasional stages,
  funded by the affluent, not only host entertaining performances but also serve
  as platforms for moral and ethical edification, embodying societal norms. In
  this milieu, classical architecture subtly weaves its narrative amid the
  vernacular, forging a harmonious, stable design fabric.
</p>

<p><strong>3) A Harmonious, Stable State</strong></p>

<p>
  In several autonomous towns across Europe, classical architecture finds a more
  pronounced voice. Beyond churches, palaces, and theatres, edifices like
  schools, financial institutions, courthouses, and even cemeteries contribute
  to the city’s classic architectural ensemble. Classical structures, commanding
  up to 10% or more of the cityscape, often overshadow the more numerous
  vernacular buildings. This dominance is a hallmark of developed societies,
  reflecting stages of evolution marked by stability and maturity.
</p>

<p><strong>4) Highly Classical: Imperial Capitals - London, Paris</strong></p>

<p>
  There exist cities, like London and Paris, and once Rome, where classical
  architecture reigns supreme. The majority of structures are not just elegant
  but are imbued with a grandeur and commemorative essence. These cities are the
  products of enduring stability, economic affluence, and colossal wealth
  accumulation, often spanning two centuries or more. The maintenance of these
  classical edifices demands substantial resources, drawing from vast
  territories and populations.
</p>

<p>
  Such cities of heightened classicism are typically the nuclei of imperial
  systems, sustained by the influx of resources from expansive hinterlands.
</p>

<p>
  While London and Paris exhibit a semblance of balance, Rome, in the twilight
  years of the empire, was a city of extravagant grandeur, where palaces and
  temples proliferated.
</p>

<p>
  However, this heightened classicism teeters on the edge of instability. Every
  city lures a influx of proletarians, prompting a demand for low-cost
  housing—vernacular architecture fills this gap. Absent the working class, a
  city cannot curtail its cost of living nor maintain long-term competitiveness.
  A city wholly gentrified is a transient illusion; a city maintained by bread
  and circuses, solely dedicated to consumption, can only exist in fragments.
</p>
