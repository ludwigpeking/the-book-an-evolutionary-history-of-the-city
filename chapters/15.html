<p><strong>The Costs of Mode Changes in Movement</strong></p>

<p>
  Most listeners have probably experienced moving homes. The fees of a moving
  company are usually divided into several parts: Firstly, there's a base fee.
  Regardless of the distance, the minimum charge is 300 yuan. Then, they charge
  8 yuan per kilometer for the vehicle's transport distance. For instance, if
  the distance is 20 kilometers, it would cost 160 yuan. Additionally, if the
  truck can't be parked right at the building's entrance and items need to be
  carried over a horizontal distance, there's an extra fee. If there's an
  elevator, the cost remains as described. However, if there isn't, they charge
  extra for carrying items up floors. I once used a moving service and spent a
  total of 880 yuan. Let me break down the costs:
</p>

<p>
  The largest distance covered by heavy items is via the truck. Yet, out of the
  total cost, only 160 yuan is actually for the transport distance. The
  remaining 720 yuan can be broadly considered as loading and unloading fees.
</p>

<p>
  This sentiment is shared by the movers. Their most relaxed and enjoyable
  moments are when they're sitting in the truck driving to the destination. On
  the other side, the processes of loading and unloading are very strenuous.
  Starting from Apartment A, they pack the items, and then, lift them onto their
  shoulders—that's one instance of loading. They place the items in the
  elevator, which is one unloading instance, then out of the elevator and onto a
  cart before loading onto the truck. Upon reaching the destination, the whole
  process is repeated in reverse. Throughout, besides human effort, three modes
  of transport are used: the truck, the cart, and the elevator. The most
  labor-intensive moments are the transitions between these modes,
  professionally termed as "mode-switching moments". Every mode switch is
  essentially a load or unload.
</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p>
  I have two ways to commute to my office. The first method: I walk to the
  parking lot, which takes 5 minutes, then drive 10 kilometers to the office in
  30 minutes, and finally walk from the office parking lot in 3 minutes. The
  whole journey takes 38 minutes, 30 of which are spent driving. The remaining 8
  minutes are effectively the cost of using the car.
</p>

<p>
  The second method: I walk 10 minutes to the subway station, spend another 5
  minutes walking inside and waiting for the train, then ride the subway for 8
  kilometers in 16 minutes. After that, I exit and catch a bus, which after
  waiting and walking takes 5 minutes, and ride it for 2 kilometers in 6
  minutes. Lastly, I walk 5 minutes from the bus stop to the office. The entire
  journey (10+5+16+5+6+5) takes 47 minutes. Even though my subway and bus rides
  total 22 minutes (faster than driving), the mode-switching time spent is 25
  minutes, making the overall trip 9 minutes slower than driving. This 25-minute
  lag is what's referred to as "mode-switching time", which can occupy a
  significant portion of the entire commute.
</p>

<p>
  Historically, it's always been like this. Moving a product from the producer's
  factory, to the wholesaler's warehouse, then to the retailer's store, and
  finally into the hands of the end-user, might involve numerous loadings and
  unloadings across various transport modes.
</p>

<p>
  The labor consumed in loading and unloading can make up a large proportion of
  the total labor in the distribution process, sometimes even being the
  majority.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, at each stage, the products might not be immediately passed on.
  Often, there's a need for storage and oversight. Some goods are easy to store,
  while others require specialized care and handling.
</p>

<p>
  In the last chapter, I mentioned many different forms of transportation,
  technically referred to as "transport modes". For instance, carrying by hand
  and carrying over the shoulder can be considered two distinct modes. Switching
  between these two positions can be exhausting. There are several transport
  modes such as mules, hand-pushed carts, horse-drawn carriages, canal boats,
  ships, trains, cars, airplanes, etc. Transitioning between these modes always
  involves loading and unloading activities.
</p>

<p>
  So, last time, we discussed how advancements in transportation technology have
  reduced the resistance in movement. However, these improvements haven't
  substantially reduced the cost of loading and unloading goods. As
  transportation becomes faster and the costs of transit decrease, the
  proportion of loading and unloading costs in the entire transportation process
  becomes increasingly significant.
</p>

<p><strong>Optimizations - Port Phenomena in History</strong></p>

<p>In movies and TV shows, we often see dockworkers portrayed.</p>

<p>
  There's a notable number of them. According to an article by Depalma in The
  New York Times, in 1950, there were 31,000 dockworkers in the New York port,
  far outnumbering the sailors.
</p>

<p>
  Dockworkers mainly work manually, specializing in loading and unloading
  specific categories and packages of goods. Due to their repetitive tasks,
  they're highly efficient. Most of them are union members, earning more than
  the average white-collar worker.
</p>

<p>
  Before modern times, dockworkers didn't exist. For instance, during Japan's
  Edo period, Nagasaki, the country's major port for foreign trade with the
  West, would see less than one Dutch merchant ship annually. Moreover, these
  ships typically stayed in the port for over a year, waiting for merchants to
  purchase and load Japanese goods for the return journey. With ample time on
  their hands, the sailors would often handle the loading and unloading
  themselves. Thus, dockworkers emerged as a specialized profession only when
  the volume of goods traded surged.
</p>

<p>
  In ports, sailors had a lot of free time. Most weren't engaged in discussing
  Cartesian mathematics. In places like Dejima in Nagasaki, local Japanese women
  would entertain the sailors — this isn't just a tangent. Historically,
  entertainment industries thrived in traditional seaports, such as Amsterdam
  and Hamburg. The same was true for many ports along the Yangtze River.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, in ports, you'll find massive, ancient warehouses. In cities
  like Nagasaki, Otaru, and Baltimore, these warehouses have even become tourist
  attractions.
</p>

<p>
  The space these warehouses occupy and the resources invested in them are also
  part of the loading and unloading costs.
</p>

<p>
  Cities, with their ever-changing scenery, evolve to optimize and streamline
  the flow and handling of goods. This is a pivotal aspect of urban evolution.
</p>

<p>
  The professional dockworker industry, specialized warehouses, and
  entertainment venues stand testament to the vast costs involved in
  transitioning between modes of transport. Yet, these establishments actually
  serve as efficient means to manage and reduce such costs. With their help, the
  costs of transition are effectively controlled.
</p>

<p>There are mainly three situations for loading, unloading, and storage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    At the point of modal switch - for instance, offloading from a truck and
    waiting for loading onto a ship.
  </li>

  <li>
    When ownership changes - like selling goods from Person A to Person B,
    transferring from A's mode of transport to B's.
  </li>

  <li>
    When raw materials need processing and enter a factory for that purpose.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  A prominent way to streamline is to combine the trade and mode transition,
  optimizing two loading/unloading operations into one. Ideally, the production
  and processing stage is also completed during this transition.
</p>

<p>
  Manufacturing industries often develop at docks. In Chicago, along the Chicago
  River, remnants of old factories, vast warehouses, and industrial facilities
  can be seen. When landing at Newark Airport, what strikes you isn't the city
  but the endless industrial ports, warehouses, and chemical companies along New
  Jersey's coastline.
</p>

<p><strong>Financial Activities from Mode Changes</strong></p>

<p>
  Ports naturally foster trading hubs. Goods from Merchant A's ship sold to
  Merchant B can be transferred directly to B's warehouse, or even a neutral
  third-party warehouse. This minimizes physical movement, reducing trading to
  mere paperwork. Goods can seamlessly transfer ownership, keeping transaction
  costs low.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine a scenario with negligible transaction costs and full transparency.
  For instance, Mr. A learns about a batch of generators in a New York warehouse
  priced at 1 million USD. He hears of an offer in Ohio for the same batch at 2
  million USD. Transporting it costs 200,000 USD. While Mr. A only has 500,000
  USD, he borrows the rest from a lender, Ms. Money. Upon sealing the deal, he
  repays her immediately. If, however, the deal doesn't go through, he could
  face a massive financial blow.
</p>

<p>
  Financial jargon like "adding stock", "reducing stock", "opening a position",
  "closing a position", and "forced liquidation" often revolve around the
  central theme of warehouses.
</p>

<p>
  Before the modern era, a country's largest warehouses were sometimes temples
  or treasuries. Banking was often a secondary industry. In the modern era, the
  most significant warehouses shifted to the docks, and modern banking took root
  there.
</p>

<p>
  The financial hub in Shanxi's Pingyao during the Qing Dynasty might baffle
  many. But it's crucial to understand that Shanxi merchants had trade
  privileges with Mongolia and Russia due to collaborations during the Ming-Qing
  transition.
</p>

<p>
  With credit comes insurance and various securities – bonds, stocks, and a
  plethora of intricate financial derivatives.
</p>

<p>
  World financial centers, like London's East End, Downtown New York, Hong Kong,
  and Shanghai's Bund, all had docks, warehouses, industries, and financial
  districts, densely packed within a small area.
</p>

<p>
  Surrounding the finance industry are legal firms, media, and policy
  organizations, typically managed by elites. Catering to these elites spurs the
  growth of high-end arts – symphonies, theater, museums, and luxury goods.
</p>

<p>
  Transport, storage, processing, and basic services are the first integration
  level. Trade and finance represent the second level. High-end arts constitute
  the third level. Only London and New York have fully integrated these three
  levels, and such dominance isn't easily shifted by one generation.
</p>

<p><strong>Containerization and the Shrinking Dock Sites</strong></p>

<p>
  Next, I'll discuss the impact of containerization technology on dock
  structures.
</p>

<p>
  The term for a container in English is "intermodal container". Literally
  translated, it means a universally usable box between modes. Observe how the
  English term precisely captures its essence – whatever you need to transport,
  you simply put it in this container. Then, whether it's on the road, on rail,
  at sea, or any mode of transport, workers just move this box without peeking
  inside or handling its contents. When switching transport modes, a
  standardized semi-automatic machine transfers this multi-ton container from a
  ship onto a truck in just a minute. Notably, these containers are universally
  sized, identical to each other.
</p>

<p>
  This technology, though sounding simple, took a long time to gain popularity.
  It was invented in the 1930s. But for its true potential to shine, associated
  ships, vehicles, and dock equipment needed simultaneous modifications. It
  faced strong resistance and litigation from dockworkers' unions, especially
  from the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA). Only by 1980 did the
  U.S. Supreme Court reject the ILA's lawsuit.
</p>

<p>
  The widespread adoption of this technology radically transformed the shipping
  industry. Compared to its peak, the number of dockworkers in New York has
  decreased by 90%. Overall transportation costs dropped even more
  significantly. Nowadays, enjoying imported goods has become commonplace. The
  word "Important" in English signifies significance, but it literally means
  "imported" (im-port), implying traditionally, imported items were crucial,
  irreplaceable, and worth any cost. Today, what's so special about imports?
  Often, they're just basic materials or primary industrial products like
  soybeans or textiles. These changes are largely attributed to the advent of
  containerization.
</p>

<p>
  Containers have also significantly transformed cities, in tandem with the
  telecommunications industry. This has led to industrial docks departing from
  urban areas. Starting from the 1980s, docks worldwide have quieted, with
  warehouses and factories ceasing operations. Vast stretches of waterfront
  land, usually adjacent to city centers and financial districts, became vacant.
  These lands, often just a street away from prime urban real estate and
  overlooking scenic seas or rivers, became highly coveted. Consequently, global
  port authorities transitioned into major developers, with projects named
  "Waterfront Redevelopment", "Harbor City", "Port Future", and the like.
</p>

<p>
  Cities such as Toronto, New York, Baltimore, Vancouver, London, Hamburg, Hong
  Kong, Yokohama, and many others have seen these transformations. Certainly,
  this is a topic worthy of a doctoral thesis. Every episode I produce could be
  turned into several theses. However, I've never written one myself, so we
  won't delve too deeply here.
</p>

<p>
  In this segment, I focused on urban integration with the shift in cargo
  transport modes, primarily showcased through dock-centered cities. In the next
  episode, I'll discuss the phenomena of human transport mode-switching, now
  also termed as the TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) structural archetype.
