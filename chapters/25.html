<h1>25 Suburbanization of China Characteristics - the Inherent Incongruity</h1>

<p>
  In this discussion on China's suburbanization, placing it in the context of
  American suburbanization makes sense due to their parallels, allowing for a
  direct comparison. American suburbanization often lacks a coherent top-down
  design, and its conceptual approach tends to be somewhat dispersed.
</p>

<p>
  In China, suburbanization typically has a top-down character. It is influenced
  by officials and experts. These experts, significantly influenced by Utopian
  modernist architectural theories, handle urban land through a mindset aligned
  with the management of state-owned assets. They essentially serve as the
  brains behind this process.
</p>

<p>
  From the bottom-up perspective of China's suburbanization, the driving forces
  are developers and consumers. It's a blend of market-driven dynamics,
  traditional elements, and even ancient concepts. Influences from local
  folklore and feng shui theories can be discerned.
</p>

<p>
  Such dichotomy between the top-down and bottom-up perspectives has inevitably
  led to a blending of the two, forming a unique discourse and following a
  distinctive logic. As a result, China's suburbanization manifests in ways that
  are quite unique and at times, internally inconsistent.
</p>

<p>
  To grasp the intricacies of China's urban development, it's essential to
  understand these varying perspectives and their origins.
</p>

<p>Chinese suburbanization has distinct features. Here are six key points:</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >One, The primary intention of China's suburban development was to construct
    new cities. However, many aspects adopted typical suburban methods.</strong
  >
  For instance, wide streets, vast city blocks, low-density road networks, and
  green belts on either side of roads all mirror the pre-WWII Athens Charter
  techniques. These are more suited for suburbs than for vibrant urban
  economies. Placing green belts along streets provides a seemingly natural
  aesthetic, catering to a simple, unrefined urban image perception. Without
  delving too deep, such setups are not pedestrian-friendly, diluting street
  vibrancy, and hindering the integration of commercial hubs and fostering a
  vibrant urban ecology. This results in a uniquely Chinese urban sprawl with
  suburban features.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Two, Areas like Pudong New District, Wangjing New Town, Hunnan New
    District, and many others represent the epitome of China's suburbanization.
    Not all these new districts are successful, but quite a few are.</strong
  >
  In some cases, property prices in these areas even surpass those in older
  districts, and vibrant new commercial centers emerge.
</p>

<p>
  The outperformance of new districts over older ones is a phenomenon of
  late-mover advantage. Globally, success stories of new cities developed
  through intensive planning based on a single blueprint are rare, with more
  failures than successes. In China, while there are numerous unsuccessful
  examples, there are also commendable cases. As previously mentioned, good
  outcomes typically emerge from solutions aligning with both top-down and
  bottom-up perspectives.
</p>

<p>
  From the top perspective, in China, developing new cities often encounters
  fewer challenges in terms of coordination and displacement compared to
  revitalizing old cities. Consequently, it's usually more cost-effective and
  more visually impressive, tapping into areas with lower resistance and clear
  outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  From the bottom perspective, akin to the situation in the U.S., these new
  districts usually attract middle-class families, creating a "middle-class
  country within a country," meeting consumer demands. Furthermore, new areas
  often provide ample parking, a stark contrast to traditional districts. Thus,
  many middle-class populations migrate from the traditional centers to these
  new areas, leading to declining vibrancy in the old districts and sometimes
  even causing new commercial centers to overshadow traditional ones.
</p>

<p>
  Developments in Chongqing's Jiangbei have diverted the buzz from traditional
  urban areas, and the population in Shenyang's Hunnan New District has
  similarly affected the city center.
</p>

<p>
  However, the supposed cost-effectiveness of these new districts comes with
  caveats. While initial costs might be lower, the long-term costs tend to be
  higher. These include the establishment of new transportation, commercial,
  medical, and educational systems, all of which must be organized from scratch
  without leveraging existing urban infrastructures. This puts a greater
  financial strain on local governments and elevates the actual user costs.
</p>

<p>
  Still, in the backdrop of China's rapid economic growth and with local
  governments benefiting from land sales, these burdens might seem manageable.
  Yet, in economically stable developed countries, the success rate of such new
  city projects is much lower.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Three, The transportation improvements behind Chinese suburbanization is a
    blend of car and public transport usage, leading to an increased reliance on
    automobiles.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Following the construction of intercity highways, many second-tier cities have
  developed urban expressway systems over the past decade. This has
  significantly spurred the growth of suburbanization. While subway and bus
  systems have also expanded, the share and usage of private cars have surged at
  a much faster rate.
</p>

<p>
  China's car ownership approximately doubles every seven to eight years. In
  2021, the nationwide car ownership rate, including in rural areas, was roughly
  0.2 cars per person. This is about half of Japan's rate and a third of that in
  the U.S. However, when accounting for urbanization levels, car ownership in
  Chinese cities is closer to Japan's and approximately half of the U.S. rate.
  Yet, it's important to recognize that with every 50% increase in car
  ownership, you'll observe a significantly different urban ecosystem.
  Therefore, China is currently undergoing a dramatic transformation in its
  urban environment, advancing at a pace of about one major shift every three
  years. I estimate that from 2013 up to now has been the period of the highest
  growth rate for car-driven suburbanization. Traffic congestion has notably
  worsened in most cities, and a decline in traditional city centers is evident
  in many areas. As previously discussed, this trend towards increased car usage
  appears nearly unstoppable.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Fourth, Chinese suburbanization is predominantly high-density,
    significantly denser than the car-centric suburbs in Western
    countries.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Viewed from a grassroots perspective, this is driven by cost and market
  demand. Chinese land prices have been relatively high for over a decade. As a
  result, achieving a high floor area ratio to dilute land costs is crucial.
</p>

<p>
  From a top-down view, government officials, aiming to conserve land, have
  implemented policies that exclude developments with a density below 1.0.
</p>

<p>
  Consequently, there's a set floor area ratio baseline for Chinese suburbs.
  Compared to the American-style car suburbs I discussed earlier, this ratio is
  many times higher.
</p>

<p>
  Any urban planner would see this as an advantage. High-density promotes the
  incubation of commercial services and sustains efficient public transit
  routes. This high-density suburban model also offers some inclusivity for
  those who don't drive.
</p>

<p>
  High density means that local urban expressways face greater pressure, leading
  to rapid saturation of these roads. Secondary road networks must develop
  concurrently, resulting in an environment with more alternative routes. Given
  that high density can accommodate more people, the sprawl of Chinese suburbs
  covers a smaller area than its American counterparts, representing a more
  resource-efficient approach.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Fifth, Chinese-style suburbs, although high-rise, have a topological
    relationship similar to the low-density suburbs in the U.S.: they are
    terminally developed.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  What does "terminally developed" mean? It refers to many pocket-like spaces,
  or what we might call cul-de-sacs. Each residential area, in its layout, is
  essentially a pocket-shaped cul-de-sac, devoid of through traffic.
  Furthermore, each high-rise building, topologically, is also a cul-de-sac as
  all residents enter and exit through a single entrance.
</p>

<p>
  You might argue, "Isn't that obvious? Aren't all houses built this way?"
  Indeed, except for shopping malls, the vast majority of houses or rooms are
  designed this way. But in traditional cities, buildings have fewer floors,
  their cul-de-sacs are on a much smaller scale, and thus less pronounced.
</p>

<p>
  Such areas represent terminal points. When these terminal developments are
  large in scale, they resemble a more specialized species. They are strongly
  environmentally dependent, with fewer opportunities for self-renewal. Such
  phenomena might not be immediately apparent, and the differences in urban
  developments often become distinguishable only after decades.
</p>

<p>
  Comparing aerial photos of Yokohama from 1980 and 2010, we find that many old
  houses on traditional streets have undergone renovations and still stand,
  while a large number of public housing estates built in the 1970s have been
  demolished and replaced.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Sixth, Chinese-style suburbs are more homogenous, more standardized, with
    many barracks-like residential areas.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  The prototype for Chinese suburbanization is Le Corbusier's "Towers in the
  Park" model, which inherently has a very uniform design. In China, this model
  has been implemented to an unprecedented scale in world history.
</p>

<p>
  This uniformity correlates with large-scale developments chasing efficiency.
  But it's not just that.
</p>

<p>
  Chinese societal thinking is more polarized. Imagine a marketplace of ideas:
  usually, 80% of people believe in 20% of ideas as mainstream knowledge, with
  20% exploring the other 80%. In a more polarized idea market, 90% believe in
  just 10% of ideas, with the other 90% of ideas intriguing only 10% of the
  population.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, compared to other regions, Chinese real estate is less of a consumer
  good and more of an asset. I believe that Chinese residences have a strong
  monetary nature and serve as primary collateral for M2 (money supply). This
  means that both builders and buyers prioritize liquidity. Ideally, all houses
  should be similar, like banknotes, differing only in face value. This
  minimizes transaction costs. This trend is becoming increasingly evident.
</p>

<p>
  From aerial views, older projects appear more complex in design. The newer the
  project, the more uniform its design. You can discern that within a given
  area, there may be only two types of apartment blocks. It might even look like
  a table laid out with different denominations of banknotes.
</p>

<p>
  Certainly, there's a wealth of detail I could delve into. However, for the
  sake of brevity and ensuring a digestible read, I've distilled my thoughts
  into the above six points.
</p>

<p>Allow me to offer a brief commentary:</p>

<p>
  When viewed through an evolutionary lens, the "Chinese-style suburbia" has
  undoubtedly matured into a significant ecological entity. It stands as a
  testament to the triumphs of China's economic reforms, showcasing immense
  financial and societal progress achieved through these transformative
  policies.
</p>

<p>
  However, I must emphasize that this Chinese suburban model has a pronounced
  consumption-driven nature. Its intensity might even be on par with the
  American suburbanization model. Reliant on the production capabilities
  unleashed by the economic reforms, this model may eventually become a
  bottleneck for further growth. Consequently, there are numerous facets of this
  model that warrant refinement or amendment. Perhaps we may even need to await
  technological advancements to alleviate the burdens it imposes.
</p>

<p><strong>Parallel Models</strong></p>

<p>
  Now, what parallel models exist in reality to this form of suburbanization?
</p>

<p>I'd draw attention to the phenomenon of Dongguan.</p>

<p>
  Initially, consider that Shenzhen is relatively compact. Dongguan and Shenzhen
  are essentially merging into a unified urban entity, sharing the economic
  infrastructure of a first-tier metropolis. One might even conceptualize
  Dongguan as an extended suburban area for Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Notably,
  Dongguan boasts a thriving manufacturing sector. However, its urban
  concentration isn't particularly dense, instead presenting a pattern of
  juxtaposed towns. Property prices there are considerably more affordable,
  approximately a quarter of those in Shenzhen. What does this signify?
</p>

<p>
  In Dongguan, a substantial proportion of urban development occurs on lands
  owned by residents. While most major cities witness a decline in such
  resident-owned land development, Dongguan maintains a more permissive stance
  toward spontaneous, grassroots developments.
</p>

<p>
  This kind of grassroots construction in urban villages significantly amplifies
  housing supply and productive spaces without necessitating much external
  input, resulting in minimal consumption.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, Dongguan offers a relatively abundant housing supply for those employed
  in manufacturing and services. This ensures a robust economic vibrancy while
  maintaining a logical property price point. This model, with higher
  inclusivity and a nurturing environment, continuously evolves and upgrades as
  long as there's sufficient property rights protection.
</p>

<p>
  Many may overlook the potential for such urban villages to autonomously
  upgrade. Yet, prime examples are evident in places like Nakano, Mitaka, and
  Kichijoji in Tokyo. Post-World War II, to address Tokyo's housing crunch, land
  near the Chūō Main Line's western suburbs was allocated and segmented into
  smaller residential plots. Initially, these areas catered to urban newcomers
  and migrant workers. Yet, over a span of 70 years, encompassing three
  generations, these locales have metamorphosed into renowned livable
  communities and hubs of cultural industries. This stands as a palpable
  alternative strategy.
</p>
