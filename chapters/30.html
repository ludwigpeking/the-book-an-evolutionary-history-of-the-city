<h1>
  30 Mechanics: The City is the Hardware of the Three Organizational Forces -
  Security, Economy, Ideology
</h1>

<p>
  In this installment, I'd like to clarify a core concept that runs through my
  series: cities are the hardware of three types of human societal organization.
  Modern humans differ little from their counterparts tens of thousands of years
  ago in terms of individual innate attributes. However, today's collective
  human abilities are far more powerful. This discrepancy arises from the
  intricate organizational systems we possess. At their core and most profound
  level, cities serve as the hardware for organizing people. The form of a city
  also embodies organizational strength, which can be categorized into three
  main types:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Firstly, economic organization</strong>. This facilitates more
  efficient solutions to basic human needs, such as food and warmth, while
  generating wealth. Surplus wealth provides the cushion needed to spur varied
  advancements and innovations. More intricate organizations foster broader,
  large-scale trade and collaborative work. Those in charge of economic matters
  are often known as guild masters, bosses, or managers. In the physical realm
  of cities, this is manifested in factories, workshops, roads, warehouses, and
  trading venues.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Secondly, defense organization</strong>. This ensures the safety of
  individuals, families, and larger groups in terms of both physical safety and
  property protection. The liberty that stems from such security is crucial for
  nurturing order. More often than not, security is not achieved individually
  but collectively. Historically, those in charge of security have typically
  been kings, nobles, or warriors. In terms of urban infrastructure, this is
  represented by walls, moats, gates, barracks, and towers. These structures
  elevate the costs for potential invaders, deterring aggression and fostering
  periods of peaceful development.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Thirdly, ideological organization</strong>. Using tools such as faith,
  worship, and identity, it is possible to establish a virtual community. This
  not only facilitates alliances both internally and externally, reducing the
  intensity of potential conflicts and destructions but also builds trust,
  lowering the transaction costs in economic organizations. Those at the helm of
  such organizations are often referred to as priests, shamans, historians,
  scholars, pastors, teachers, or political workers. The importance of
  ideological organization is a hallmark of advanced civilizations. Within the
  urban context, this is reflected in monuments, public buildings, and various
  culturally and ceremonially significant constructions and spaces.

<p>
  These three organizational powers are embodied in various artifacts in
  civilized societies. To illustrate, consider two cartoons. First, imagine a
  silhouette of an average person. We make three copies. To the first, we add a
  defensive weapon, a sword. He then appears somewhat aggressive, reminiscent of
  a bandit. To the second, we dress him in a suit and grant him a ceremonial top
  hat. Now, he seems to exude authority, much like an Orient Express conductor.
  To the final one, we give a full ensemble—a suit, a top hat, and a sword.
  Suddenly, he takes on the air of nobility, even resembling Emperor Franz
  Joseph of Austria.

  /></a>

<p>
  For the next cartoon, envision a simple one-story house. Again, we produce
  three replicas. The first one is elevated to a three-story building. Although
  still plain, it suggests a prime location, much like an inn from the Chinese
  series "My Own Swordsman." To the second, we add ceremonial decorations, like
  ornate ridges on its roof, transforming it into something resembling a small
  temple, where one might expect devotees to visit. Lastly, upon the three-story
  building, we place the decorations, set it on a grand stone base, and it
  evolves into a majestic castle, reminiscent of the stronghold from where Oda
  Nobunaga once ruled.

<p>
  Cities and architecture establish organizational strength and order through
  their various components. I've previously discussed the mechanisms of defense
  systems in my 99th issue, so I won't delve into it again. Let me expand a bit
  on the tangible representations of ideational organization:
</p>

<p>
  A piece of clothing serves not only to maintain warmth and protect the body
  but can also signify one's social status or even political leanings. Whether
  Zuckerberg wears a hoodie or a suit and tie, both choices are laden with class
  distinctions and representational meanings. Furniture, ranging from the
  simplest to the ornately decorated or the sleekly modern, has consistent
  functional purposes. However, it reflects the owner's cultural preferences and
  affiliations. A simplistic entrance to a residential community might
  disappoint potential buyers. There was a news story this year about a
  homebuyer who loudly protested in front of a developer's office, claiming that
  the main gate was an embarrassment and he sought to restore dignity for the
  residents. His point was valid. A gate is not just a physical security measure
  but also carries symbolic value. The doors of the courtyard homes during the
  Ming and Qing dynasties in Beijing strictly corresponded to the homeowner's
  status. Wealthy merchants, while commoners, differentiated themselves with
  lavish decorations. In the ancient city of Pompeii in Italy, the colorful
  mosaics in front of the houses showcased the owner's wealth and artistic
  taste. Reputation and face are crucial, influencing one's personal influence,
  the cost of transactions, and even mate selection. In other words, uniting
  people through shared concepts to transact or act collectively is significant.
  Investment in preserving and showcasing face, through commemorative or
  political constructions, is prioritized by everyone from emperors and nobles
  to merchants and commoners. Those with abundant resources invest more in
  maintaining face. The grandest buildings in cities are often banks and
  insurance companies, their solid granite façades symbolizing centuries of
  endurance. Urban roads are not merely transport infrastructures; magnificent
  boulevards are monuments themselves, representing the political prowess of
  rulers. All entities, throughout ages and classes, optimize their position in
  these organizational realms based on their circumstances and stances.
</p>

<p>
  From prehistoric times, people adorned and carved their primitive huts to
  display wealth and status. The higher the status, the larger and more refined
  the carvings. These structures served as tools to imprint class order onto
  people's hearts. Even in egalitarian eras, some architects, driven by
  idealism, deliberately built undecorated, austere, and standardized houses to
  express an egalitarian ideology. Without a doubt, they were creating
  distinctions from the old order, with an equally strong intent of establishing
  a new order. However, such constructions by these 'progressive' architects
  didn't resonate with the masses; instead, they evoked admiration from a
  distance. Their detachment from the public and their impulse to erect
  monuments for themselves were no less than that of ancient monarchs.
</p>

<p><strong>the Overstated Security and Monumental Elements</strong></p>

<p>
  The perspectives of rulers and the ruled both align and conflict. The
  difference is that when conflicts arise, the ruled usually lack the means to
  inflict significant harm on rulers. Rulers, with their power, have more
  chances to implement their intentions, and when they cause harm, it's more
  conspicuous. The Han and Tang dynasties' capital, Chang'an, implemented
  curfews in every district, with residents effectively living in 'soft
  prisons', restricted from venturing out at night. This infringed on their
  freedoms and economic interests but efficiently curtailed possible revolts and
  reduced security costs. In Bucharest, Romania, during Ceaușescu's reign, vast
  areas of the historic city center were demolished to make way for grand
  avenues and monumental government buildings, like the Palace of the
  Parliament. The demolition's extent was likened to the destruction caused by
  the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. Locals coined the term "Ceaushima" – a fusion of
  "Ceaușescu" and "Hiroshima" – to refer to the devastated area.
</p>

<p>
  While appropriate monument construction can foster organizational cohesion,
  overzealous monument building can be a risky gamble, sometimes backfiring on
  its creator.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The pattern of a city reflects its social structure</strong> and the
  balance of power among the various classes.
</p>

<p>
  In Tokyo, the design of many areas is intricate and irregular, characterized
  by urban village bases, small-scale industries, and a maze of tiny streets and
  alleys. Main roads primarily serve as transportation routes, lacking
  monumental significance. However, individual buildings are generally clean and
  respectable; traffic congestion is not severe. Large real estates and capital
  are primarily evident in areas with special historical backgrounds and
  especially central commercial districts. This design mirrors a society
  primarily composed of commoners and a government that serves its citizens.
</p>

<p>
  London's streets are winding and complex. The city has a significant
  proportion of medium-scale industries and old buildings, all of high
  architectural quality from various eras. There are no monumental avenues. The
  city's layout reveals a society that has remained stable for centuries and the
  accumulation of diverse traditional powers.
</p>

<p>
  Paris, before the mid-19th century, had a layout similar to London's—filled
  with small streets and alleys. Under the reign of Napoleon III, Baron
  Haussmann supervised the construction of a radiating network of roads,
  amplifying the city's monumental aspect. This project gave Paris a distinct
  character, but it was also a source of significant controversy. Additionally,
  the Haussmann renovations seem to mark a watershed moment in French history.
  Paris, with its narrow lanes from the Valois dynasty to Napoleon I, did not
  hinder the French military from dominating Europe. Yet, by 1870, with its
  newly designed grand boulevards, France quickly lost the Franco-Prussian War
  and thereafter relied repeatedly on allies to defend itself.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, it wasn't Paris's urban renovation that led to France's martial
  decline. Such a project doesn't have that much influence. Instead, this
  project reflected the decay of French grassroots society and the zenith of its
  bureaucratic system. As the saying goes, "From a single twig, one can predict
  the coming of autumn." The character of a city often accurately mirrors the
  power structure of the society in which it exists.
</p>

<p>
  Economics, defense, and ideas—the discussion about these three organizational
  forces will continue throughout my series.
