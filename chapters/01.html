<h1>01 Examples: the Three Tourist Attractions with the Same Morphism</h1>
<p></p>

<p>
  Beginning with this chapter, I will give a series of lecture on viewing cities
  from an evolutionary perspective.
</p>

<p>
  Biological communities and economic systems are commonly understood as
  evolutionary. This notion extends to areas including computer algorithms,
  linguistics, aesthetic trends, Earth's geomorphology, and the universe's
  structure, all analyzed as evolutionary systems.
</p>

<p>
  However, the city - a place where everyone lives their daily lives, and an
  obvious evolutionary system - is often seen as a product of human design, and
  is thought to be something drawn out of a blueprint. So much so that the
  discipline of studying cities is called ‘urban planning’ or ‘urban design’
  acknowledging a prevailing assumption that cities are products of deliberate
  planning and design.
</p>

<p>
  Adhering to this viewpoint, however, can obscure a deeper comprehension of
  urban dynamics. And those in power keep creating hideous cities based on their
  arbitrariness.
</p>

<p>
  And if you give up the urge to plan and instead examine the city as an
  evolving system, you will dramatically increase your opportunity to
  systematize and structure urban knowledge. The knowledge gathered from this
  approach often has stronger explanatory power, making it useful for diagnosing
  a city's problems or predicting its future trajectory. Pioneered by Charles
  Darwin and Friedrich Hayek, great scholars like Richard Dawkins, Stewart
  Brand, and Michael Batty have also contributed to this discourse.
</p>

<p>
  The ancestors of whales and sharks had significant differences, yet they
  evolved similar physical forms due to their similar habitats and occupying
  similar ecological niches. This analogy extends to urban environments, where
  cities may evolve comparable structural features in response to similar
  environmental pressures. In the following paragraphs, I will provide
  <b>three examples </b>to further illustrate this concept.
</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Kaminarimon Gate，Tokyo</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>
  Those who have visited Sensoji Temple in Tokyo may remember a long, narrow
  street that stretches between the temple's main gate and the Kaminarimon Gate.
  This street is ‘over 200 meters long and about 7-8 meters wide, with a column
  of small shops on either side, 54 on the east and 35 on the west’ (Asakusa
  Nakamise Shopping Street Association 2008), permanent and prestigious, but
  similar to the setting of temporary stalls in a flea market. You can weave
  through the gaps between these shops to get to the back of the stores. Behind
  each row of shops, there is a street that runs parallel to the central street,
  and along the outer street, there are shops that have a more classical
  appearance. All three streets have shops, parallel to each other, leading from
  the Kaminarimon Gate to the temple.
</p>

<p>(Figure above: Kaminarimon Gate from Microsoft maps)</p>

<p>
  It is evident that this thoroughfare was originally an expansive avenue,
  extending over 20 meters in width, deliberately designed to lead to the
  temple, embodying a monumental grandeur. Architecturally speaking, it
  possessed a significant commemorative and monumental character. On festival
  days, the avenue teemed with a multitude of pilgrims and worshippers, lending
  it a vibrant atmosphere, and concurrently, numerous vendors capitalized on
  this influx by setting up stalls for commercial gain.
</p>
<p>
  Looking into the history record (23 Special Wards of Tokyo Council official
  record), the right of running stalls were originally granted to the group to
  take the duty of cleaning the temple precinct. A strategic question arises:
  where would these stalls be optimally positioned? Logically, they would not be
  located directly in the center of the avenue, as this would impede the direct
  path of the pilgrims towards the temple, necessitating the maintenance of a
  sufficiently wide passageway. Additionally, positioning stalls in front of the
  permanent storefronts lining the avenue would obstruct customer access, thus
  requiring the preservation of an unobstructed pathway for these
  establishments. Consequently, the stalls were predominantly situated slightly
  off-center, either to the left or right of the avenue's midpoint.
</p>

<img src="./img/0110.jpg" alt="" class="middle-diagram" />

<img src="./img/0108.jpg" alt="" class="middle-diagram" />

<p>
  (Figures above: the pilgrimage passage over time. Top: original passage in
  early Edo Era. Middle: late Edo Era. Bottom: modern era.)
</p>

<p>
  This arrangement, borne out of practical necessity, was proven over time not
  to disrupt the flow of the pilgrimage. Interestingly, these temporary stalls
  garnered remarkable commercial success, surpassing the established shops
  flanking the avenue. This raises the question of potential commercial harm to
  the permanent storefronts. However, this was not the case. The introduction of
  these stalls intensified the avenue's competitive commercial environment,
  enhancing the shopping experience by offering greater convenience and
  affordability. This transformation elevated the avenue's status as a paramount
  destination for belief, tourism, and shopping. Despite the partial obstruction
  and diminished visibility caused by the stalls, and the diversion of some
  business, the established shops benefited significantly from the augmented
  pedestrian traffic, ultimately witnessing an increase in overall profits.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, the temple, being the proprietor of the avenue, capitalized on
  this evolution by collecting fees from the stall vendors and eventually
  institutionalizing the presence of these stalls. Through these evolutionary
  changes, this avenue, located at the forefront of the temple, emerged as one
  of Tokyo's most illustrious temple fair streets.
</p>

<p>
  In the process of transformation, it is conceivable that contradictions,
  conflicts, and adjustments were prevalent. For instance, there were instances
  where stalls were set up exceedingly close to the center, impeding traffic
  flow. Additionally, certain stalls completely obstructed the entrances of
  established shops, adversely affecting their business operations. However,
  after a period of negotiation and adaptation, all parties involved on the
  street eventually reaped benefits. The central roadway was reduced to 8 meters
  in width, naturally not as conducive for movement as the original expanse of
  over 20 meters, but it remained sufficiently functional.
</p>

<p>
  Should one singularly emphasize the transit efficacy of this street, it is
  indeed apparent that it has diminished. However, the majority of the street's
  users and stakeholders have acknowledged and accepted this transformation.
</p>

<p>
  One can imagine certain individuals who never utilized these small stalls,
  such as authoritative figures like the Shogun. Hypothetically, if the Shogun,
  while passing through the Kaminarimon, had noticed these stalls and remarked
  on their detrimental effect on the cityscape, and if the temple authorities
  had acquiesced to his wishes by dismantling the stalls, the result would have
  been a much wider but mundane street. Such a scenario did not happen on the
  Shogun, contrarily, upon the municipal authorities assuming control over the
  temple's rights in 1885, the entire commercial street was demolished,
  resulting in significant losses for the vendors. Hence, it is observed that
  the arbitrary and forceful actions of a democratically elected government are
  not necessarily less arbitrary than those of a feudal ruler. Fortuitously, the
  commercial street, owing to its traditional economic value, was soon restored
  and continues to thrive to this day.
</p>

<p><strong>Ponte di Rialto, Venice</strong></p>
<img src="./img/0107.jpg" alt="" class="middle-diagram" />
<p>(Figure above: from Salvatore Russo, 2016)</p>

<p>
  The next example is in Venice, which has a unique transportation system
  consisting of both water and land routes. The land system consists of many
  connected alleys and bridges . The most important bridge here is, without a
  doubt, the Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal. Before the 19th century, it was
  the only bridge over the Grand Canal in Venice. The bridge connects the market
  and two of Venice's central districts.
</p>

<p>
  The beautiful arches on the bridge might create a misconception that they
  meant to provide shelter for pedestrians. But actually only shops are under
  the roof of the colonnades. Between these shops, the pedestrian passage is
  contrarily open to the air. Further details are omitted here; however, these
  rows of shops bear resemblance to the stalls at the Kaminarimon shopping
  street. They divide the wide bridge deck into three parallel passages.
</p>

<p>
  (Figures above: compared 12th century wooden Rialto Bridge, with shops on its
  deck, and modern Rialto Bridge, with shops more pronounced by its colonnade.

</p>

<p>
  The significant pedestrian traffic on the bridge greatly contributed to the
  success of its shops. These shops were also a key part of the bridge's
  architectural design, becoming prominent visual features. The inclusion of
  these shops was planned during the bridge’s reconstruction in 1591, and this
  aspect has been maintained since then. This design choice, however, was not
  necessarily due to the foresight of the architects. Originally, there was a
  wooden bridge in this location, which initially had no shops. Maintaining a
  wooden bridge required funds, and while collecting tolls was a straightforward
  option, the Venetian authorities decided to construct shops on the bridge,
  using the rent from these shops for maintenance. This approach proved to be
  more beneficial than just collecting tolls, embedding commercial activity into
  the bridge’s identity. This integration of shops became a lasting tradition,
  so much so that when the wooden bridge was replaced with a stone bridge, this
  commercial element was preserved. The Rialto Bridge is more than just a
  transportation link in Venice; it has become a self-supporting entity
  combining mutual benefits and functionality (Dupré, Judith 2017).
</p>

<p>
  This concept of combining commercial spaces with bridge structures was not
  unique to Venice, rather it was a quite common practice. Other notable
  examples include Florence's Ponte Vecchio and London Bridge, which, before the
  19th century, not only hosted a market but also had residential spaces above
  it (Pierce, Patricia 2001).

<p><strong>Chien Men Avenue, Beijing</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>
  Imperial China has often been viewed as traditionally more autocratic and less
  friendly towards the free market. However, there is an example that suggests
  that at some point in time, the traditional authorities could be more tolerant
  towards spontaneous activities, even more than the modern ones. This example
  is the Chien Men Avenue in Beijing, which is the 30-meter-wide axial street in
  front of the Forbidden City.
</p>

<p>
  If one visits Chien Men Avenue today, they will find a small street on each
  east and west side, located behind the shops along the main street. The street
  on the west is called Jewelry Street, and the one on the east is called Fruit
  Alley. They are parallel to Chien Men Avenue and form a system of three
  parallel roads. When I visited it in 2017, I immediately realized that this
  could be a result of informal occupation on a once broader avenue. I later
  find its evidence:
</p>

<p>
  The original Chien Men Avenue was a 60-meter-wide monumental avenue. As it
  served not only as the front door of Beijing but also as the route for the
  emperors to the Temple of Heaven to offer sacrifices. As early as the late
  Ming Dynasty, there were already many temporary shacks on Chien Men Avenue,
  which formed two columns of continuous shacks. 'Notes from Hongyi Pavilion,'
  recorded an incident that occurred at Chien Men during the late Ming Dynasty.
  It states, 'In front of Beijing's Front Gate, shelters were erected and
  occupied as shops, a practice long established.' In the seventh year of the
  Chongzhen Emperor's reign, the residence of a royal, Zhu Chunchen, was
  destroyed by fire on a festival day. Consequently, the city's officials
  demolished all the shelters that encroached upon the official street and
  obstructed the roadways, for they hindered the fire fighting. In response to
  this event, Imperial Attendant Jin Guangchen immediately petitioned the
  Emperor, stating: 'The capital's impoverished residents, who rent shelters
  without means, barely eke out a living through trade, their professions meager
  and their plight pitiable.' He argued that the wholesale demolition of these
  shelters was inconsiderate of the hardships of separation. He further
  questioned: 'If a fire spreads to a shelter, should we then destroy all
  shelters, just as if it spreads to an inner chamber, should we also destroy
  all inner chambers?' Following this memorial, the Emperor, deeming the
  argument reasonable, halted the demolition of the Chien Men shelters,
  preserving the existing structures.（ Gao Yongyan, Zhu Yizun, 1687）

<p>
  Over time, the passage between the two columns of shacks has become the main
  street of Chien Men Avenue. These shacks have gradually become more valuable
  and turned into permanent shops, housing many luxurious stores. Meanwhile, the
  original edge of the street, the part behind the shacks, has become two alleys
  mainly housing small shops that sell daily supplies.What is more interesting
  is, in an old photo around 1900, the guards of honor of Emperor Guangxu and
  Empress Dowager Cixi were returning to the Forbidden City through the Chien
  Men Avenue after the Boxer Incident subsided. In the photo, there were two new
  columns of stalls in the already narrowed avenue. Another round of informal
  occupation has taken place. The left right of way was being eroded. This wave
  just did not get formalized. But, if we view the photos of the Avenue in time
  sequence, we realize it is gradually narrowed, until the modern municipality
  entered the history, and trolley bus was introduced.

<div><strong>Remarks</strong></div>

<p>
  The three examples of Tokyo's Kaminarimon, Venice's Rialto Bridge, and
  Beijing's Chien Men Avenue can be considered isomorphic. Each involves
  introducing stalls into pre-designed passageways, a form of temporary or
  informal occupation. Over time, these adaptations evolve into new traditions,
  transforming the original street layouts. This evolution results from
  negotiations and a balance of interests among various stakeholders, coupled
  with authority tolerance. These stakeholders include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Through Traffic: likes the spaciousness of the passage, dislikes the shacks’
    narrowing the passage; but in case there are services provided, he/she may
    join the shoppers, and benefit from it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shopper: likes the convenience/affordability provided by the commercial
    activity; hates the disorder of poorly organized setting; hates also the
    elimination of the activity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Business owners:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Original street frontage owner: likes the economic gains from the
        traffic, likes to push the frontage closer to the traffic; hates
        objects, shacks blocking his frontage; but likes the traffic attracted
        by other businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shack operator: likes to take advantage of the traffic, will try to be
        at the point of most traffic; like to formalize his claim; fears the
        hatred by the original owners and purposeful travelers and the
        relinquishment of his establishment due to public or authoritative
        sentiment;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Authority:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Community organization: likes the collective interests of the local;
        hates rule breakers; hates intervention from the higher authorities;
      </li>
      <li>
        Bureaucrat: likes the ‘good’ appearance, likes to be politically
        correct, as being fair, being cautious; hates hazards, conflicts and
        chaotic appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Autocratic ruler: favors tax and prosperity; dislikes the reduction of
        his authority or control over the society.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
  The process is a complex game among all parties, each individual would act to
  maximize his own interests, but is countered by other parties. It is an
  accumulation of the decisions made by all the individuals over time, although
  each of them may have different weight. Good practice arises from a balanced
  situation, where traditions regulate the behavior of the participants, and
  intentional organization might invent or reinvent the traditions.

</div>
<p>
  Moreover, the three examples have demonstrated the fact that the fundamental
  driving force behind these processes is human nature, desire, and behavior
  patterns, and the self-evolving structure of cities is universal and
  transcends cultures and regions.
