<p>
  Beginning with this chapter, I will give a series of lecture on viewing cities
  from an evolutionary perspective.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Most people know that a biological community is an evolutionary system.
  Economic systems are also recognized as evolutionary systems. In addition to
  these, computer algorithms, human language, aesthetic preferences, the
  topography of the Earth's surface, and even the large-scale structure of the
  universe are all studied as evolutionary systems.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, the city - a place where everyone lives their daily lives, and a very
  obvious evolutionary system - is often considered to be created by human will,
  and is thought to be something drawn out of a blueprint. So much so that the
  discipline of studying cities is called "urban planning" or "urban design".
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems as though it is natural for cities to be planned and designed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Following this line of thought, people easily lose the opportunity to
  understand cities. And those in power keep creating hideous cities based on
  their arbitrariness.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  And if you give up the urge to plan and instead examine the city as an
  evolving system, you will dramatically increase your opportunity to
  systematize and structure urban knowledge. The knowledge gathered from this
  approach often has stronger explanatory power, making it useful for diagnosing
  a city's problems or predicting its future trajectory.
</p>

<p>
  The ancestors of whales and sharks had significant differences, yet they
  evolved similar physical forms due to their similar habitats and occupying
  similar ecological niches. This illustrates how environments can drive the
  evolution of species towards similar traits. Similarly, cities can also evolve
  similar forms in response to comparable environmental pressures. In the
  following paragraphs, I will provide three examples to further illustrate this
  point.

<p><strong>Kaminarimon Gate，Tokyo</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Those who have visited Sensoji Temple in Tokyo may remember a long, narrow
  street that stretches between the temple's main gate and the Kaminarimon Gate.
  This street is over 200 meters long and about 7-8 meters wide, with rows of
  small shops on either side that are connected together, similar to temporary
  stalls in a flea market. You can weave through the gaps between these shops to
  get to the back of the stores. Behind each row of shops, there is a street
  that runs parallel to the central street, and along the outer street, there
  are shops that have a more classical appearance. All three streets have shops,
  parallel to each other, leading from the Kaminarimon Gate to the main gate of
  the temple.

<p>
  Those who have been to Asakusa Temple in Tokyo may remember that between the
  temple gate and the Kaminarimon gate on the main street, there is a long
  alley, more than 200 meters long and about seven or eight meters wide. On both
  sides are rows of small shops, whose sizes are like temporary stalls in a
  marketplace. You can go through the gaps between these shops and round to the
  back of the shops. You will find that behind the rows of shops on each side,
  there is a street. It runs parallel to the middle street and along the outer
  street are more classical-looking shops. These three streets all have shops,
  parallel to each other, leading from theKaminarimongate to the temple gate.

  Obviously, not in the middle of the road, as people need a clear path to the
  temple, and not in front of fixed stores lining the sides of the boulevard, as
  customers need unobstructed access. Thus, vendors can only set up their stalls
  slightly to the left or right of the center of the street. Over time, this
  setup has proven to not impede the flow of visitors. These small stalls have
  become incredibly popular, even surpassing the sales of the stores that
  originally lined the street. But did this harm the established businesses? Not
  really. With these new stalls, competition on the street increased, making
  shopping more convenient and affordable, and turning it into a top destination
  for tourists. Although these stores were partially blocked by the stalls,
  reducing their visibility and even losing some business to the stalls, they
  still benefited from the increased foot traffic. Overall, their profits have
  increased compared to before. The owners of the street, the temple itself, can
  now collect fees from the vendors and even make these stalls permanent
  fixtures. Through these changes, this street in front of the temple has become
  Tokyo's most famous temple fair street.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  We can imagine that in the process of the changes, there are contradictions,
  conflicts, and adjustments. For example, someone once set up a stall very
  close to the center, blocking traffic. There are also booths that completely
  block the doors of permenent stores, which affects their business. But after
  some time of coordination and operation, all parties on this street have
  benefitted. The road in the middle has become 8 meters, of course it is not as
  easy as the original 20 meters for the traffic. But it still functions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If you one-sidedly emphasize the traffic efficiency of this street, the
  traffic capacity has indeed decreased. However, the vast majority of users and
  stakeholders of this street approve of this change.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As you can imagine, some people are unlikely to use these stalls, such as the
  Shogun. If one day, he were to walk past the temple gate and notice these
  small stalls, he might say, "It ruins the city's appearance." If the temple
  people were to obey his words and remove all the small stalls, you would end
  up with a wider but less interesting street. However, that didn't happen.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ponte Rialto, Venice</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The next example is in Venice, one of the wealthiest European cities from the
  Middle Ages to modern times.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Venice has a unique transportation system consisting of both water and land
  routes. The land system consists of many connected small streets and bridges .
  The most important bridge here is, without a doubt, the Rialto Bridge on the
  Grand Canal. Before the 19th century, it was the only bridge over the Grand
  Canal in Venice. The bridge connects the market and two of Venice's central
  districts.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  You may think the beautiful arches on the bridge meant to provide shelter for
  pedestrians. But, actually only shops are under the left and right colonnades.
  Between these shops, the pedestrian passage is open to air.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Because I have already talked about the pedestrian street of Sensoji Temple, I
  won't go into detail here. These rows of shops are akin to the stalls at the
  Kaminarimon shopping street. . They divide the wide bridge deck into three
  parallel passages.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For the large foot traffic over the bridge, these shops are of course very
  successful from the perspective of commercial real estate. Moreover, they are
  also emphasized by the architectural design and become the most eye-catching
  visual elements on the bridge. Did the architect have the foresight to build
  these shops when the bridge was built? The answer is yes. These shops were
  planned and designed even before the bridge was built in 1591, and they have
  remained in place to this day. However, it was not due to any designer's
  prescience.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In fact, there used to be a wooden bridge here before. At first, there were no
  shops on this wooden bridge. However, it costs money to maintain wooden
  bridges. In order to collect funds for bridge repairs, it is obvious that the
  most direct way is to collect bridge tolls. However, at that time, the Venice
  government chose to build two rows of shops on it, relying on the rent to
  maintain the bridge. These two rows of shops are considered by the Venetians
  to be an effective facility. They clearly create more value than simply
  charging bridge tolls. (Dupré, Judith 2017)
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  And the existence of these shops has become a tradition. So much so that when
  the wooden bridge was destroyed and the stone bridge was rebuilt, this
  tradition was still preserved.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Rialto Bridge is much more than a simple transportation facility in
  Venice, it has become a self-sustaining entity that maintains an open and
  mutually beneficial situation. Similar arrangements are not uncommon in the
  world. The Ponte Vecchio in Florence is another famous example. Prior to the
  19th century, the London Bridge not only had a market on the bridge deck, but
  also several layers of apartments above the market.

<p><strong>Chien</strong> Men <strong>Avenue, Beijing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  China has often been viewed as traditionally more autocratic and less friendly
  towards the free market. However, there is an example that suggests that at
  one point in time, it was more tolerant towards spontaneous activities. This
  example is the Chien Men Avenue in Beijing, which is the axial street in front
  of the Forbidden City.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If one visits Chien Men Avenue today, they will find a small street on each
  east and west side, located behind the shops along the main street. The street
  on the west is called Jewelry Street, and the one on the east is called Fruit
  Hutong. They are parallel to Chien Men Avenue and form a system of three
  parallel roads.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, the original Chien Men Avenue was a 60-meter-wide monumental avenue.
  As it served not only as the front door of Beijing but also as the route for
  the emperors to the Temple of Heaven to offer sacrifices.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As early as the late Ming Dynasty, there were already many temporary
  commercial stalls on Chien Men Avenue, which formed two columns of continuous
  shacks. Although occupied by shacks, the passage in the middle was still 30
  meters wide, more than enough for large traffic. Later, a trolley way was even
  added through it. Over time, the passage between the two columns of shacks has
  become the main street of Chien Men Avenue. These shacks have gradually become
  more valuable and turned into permanent shops, housing many luxurious stores.
  Meanwhile, the original edge of the street, the part behind the shacks, has
  become two alleys mainly housing small shops that sell daily supplies.（ Zhu
  Yizun, 1687）
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  What is more interesting is,  in a old photo around 1900, the guards of honor
  of Emperor Guangxu and Empress Dowager Cixi were returning to the Forbidden
  City through the Chien Men Avenue after the Boxer Incident subsided. In the
  photo, there were two new columns of stalls in the already narrowed avenue.
  Another round of informal occupation has taken place. The left 30m right of
  way was being eroded. This wave just did not get formalized.

<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The three examples of Tokyo's Sensoji Temple, Venice's Rialto Bridge, and
  Beijing's Qianmen Avenue can be considered isomorphic. They all involve adding
  stalls to a designed passageway, which is known as temporary or informal
  occupation. Over time and through the city's adaptation, these occupations
  have formed a new tradition, changing the original layout of the streets and
  completing an evolution. This process involves the negotiation and balancing
  of the interests of the various participants, as well as the authority's
  tolerance. For example, we can see that the emperor of the Qing dynasty was
  not as persistent in removing illegal constructions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Moreover, the self-evolving structure of cities is universal and transcends
  cultures and regions. The fundamental driving force behind these processes is
  human nature, desire, and behavior patterns.

<p>The original lecture in Chinese :</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>01 同構三名勝——做为演化系统的城市</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>从这期开始，我搞一个从演化的视角看城市的讲座。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>生物群落，大家一般都知道他是一个演化系统。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  经济系统，也被当做演化系统来被认知。除此之外，计算机算法、人类的语言、审美偏好、地球表面的地形地貌、甚至宇宙的大尺度结构，这些都被当成演化系统来研究。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，城市——一个每个人日常生活的场所，一个非常明显的演化系统——却经常被当成人的意志的创造，被认为是用蓝图画出来的东西。以至于研究城市的学科，被称为“城市规划“或者“城市设计”。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>仿佛城市被规划、被设计是理所当然的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  沿着这种思路，人很容易失去理解城市的机会。
  或者，权力者，会从个人的意志为出发点，制造很多蹩脚的城市。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而如果你放弃规划的冲动，反过来把城市当成一个演化系统来考察，那你把城市知识化和结构化的机会陡增，而且从中汇聚起来的知识，也往往具有更强的解释能力。用于诊断一个城市的问题，或者预测一个城市的进程。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  鲸鱼和鲨鱼的祖先差异非常大，确具有形态上的相似，这是它们在类似的环境中生活，并且占据了类似生态位的结果。类似的环境，也会推动城市向类似的形态去演化。下面我提供三个场所作为例子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  雷门：去过东京浅草寺的人可能会记得，寺院的大门和大街上的雷门之间，有一条长长的小街，200多米长，大概七八米宽，左右两侧是连成列的一间间小小店铺，，其尺寸就像自由市场的临时摊位。你可以通过这些店铺间的缝隙，绕到店铺的背后，你会发现，左右两列店铺的背后，各有一条街。和中间的街平行，沿着外侧的街道，是看起来更加古典的店铺。这三条街，都有店铺，平行的，从雷门通向寺院的大门。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  很显然，这条街，原本是一条20多米宽的大街，是专门通向寺庙的，非常宏伟，用建筑学的术语说，非常Monumental，具有纪念性。在节日的时候，这里进香参拜的人很多，很热闹，也会有很多人来摆摊赚钱。摆摊的时候，你会在哪里摆摊呢？答案是你不会堵在路的正中间，因为大家要直直的朝寺庙走过去，而且你要留下一条比较宽的通道；同时，你又不能挡住大街边的固定商家的门脸，所以你要给他们留下一个通道，让顾客可以自由进出；所以，只能在街中间偏左或者偏右的地方摆摊。久而久之，实践证明，这种摆摊方式，不会影响参拜的交通。小摊位的生意非常火爆，超过了原来街两侧的商店；这是不是对这些商店的损害呢？没有。由于有了这些小摊位，这条街的竞争更加充分，购物更加方便实惠，成为了一个非常重要的观光和购物目的地，虽然这些商店一定程度上被摊位阻挡了，损害了他们的展示效果，甚至他们的生意被小摊位超过了，但是他们从人流的增加上得到了充分的好处。整体看他们的收益比原来更多。这条街道的所有者，寺院本身，可以收取摆摊人的摊位费。甚至将这些摊位永久化。这条寺庙前的大街，经过了这样一番改变，就形成了东京最著名的一条庙会街。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们可以想象，在改变的过程中，有矛盾，有冲突，有调整。比如，曾经有人摆摊非常靠近中心，阻挡了交通。还有摊位彻底堵死了固定商店的大门，影响了人家的生意。但是经历了一些时间的协调和磨合，这条街道上的各方都实现的获益。中间的道路变成了8米，当然不如原来20多米走起来痛快。但是勉强用，也足够了。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你如果片面的强调这条街的通行效果，通行效果确实下降了。但是，这条街的绝大多数使用者和利益相关者，认可了这种改变。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你可以想象，有些人是从来不用这些小摊的，比如将军大人。假如有一天他老人家，走过雷门，发现这些小摊，说“太破坏市容市貌了”。如果寺庙的人乖乖的听他的话，把小摊都拆掉。那么你今天得到的将是一条宽得多，但是意义平淡的多的街道。但是这种情况并没有发生。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果你认为这种对小摊贩的宽容是现代化很晚的日本特有的，那么，我给你举一个中世纪到近代最富裕的欧洲城市，威尼斯的例子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  威尼斯的交通，分为水陆两个系统，其中路上的系统是很多小街道和桥串联起来的。这里面最重要的一座桥，那么毫无疑问，是大运河上的Rialto&nbsp;里亚尔多桥。在19世纪之前，这是威尼斯大运河上唯一的一座桥。这座桥连接着市场和威尼斯最主要的两个区。你看这座桥上有优美的拱廊，你以为它是给行人遮风挡雨的吗？
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>不是的，实际上拱廊有左右两列，拱廊下面是两列店铺。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  因为我前面已经讲过了浅草寺的步行街，这里我也就不再赘述，这两排店铺，就相当于雷门里面的摊位。它们把宽阔的桥面分割成平行的三条通道。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在人来人往的主桥上，这些店铺从商业地产的角度上当然是非常成功。而且，它们还得到建筑设计上的强调，成为桥上最醒目的视觉元素。难道，建桥的时候，建筑师就有先见之明，建了这些店铺吗？答案是：确实，这些店铺，从1591年这座桥建成之前就设计好了，并且一直存在到现在。但是它也不是出于什么设计者的先见之明。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  事实上，在它之前，这里曾经是一个木头桥。这座木头桥上，最开始是没有店铺的。但是，维修木头桥是要花钱的，为了收集修桥的经费，很明显，我们最直接的办法是收取过桥费。不过，当时威尼斯政府选择在上面建起了两列店铺，靠收租金来维护大桥。而这两排店铺，被威尼斯人认为是一种有效的便利设施。它们显然比单纯收取过桥费创造了更多的价值。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而且这些店铺的存在，成为了一种传统。以至于，在木桥被毁，重建石桥的时候，这种传统仍然得以保留。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  利亚尔多桥因此大于一个简单的交通设施，成为一个自我维持的实体。长期保持着开放的和互利的局面。类似的安排在世界上并不罕见。佛罗伦萨的Ponte
  Vecchio是另一个著名的例子。19世纪之前的伦敦桥上，不但桥面上有市场，市场楼上还有若干层公寓。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  上面两个例子足够有名，但是我还可以给你一个更加有名，而且离我们很近的例子。这就是——前门大街。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你如果逛前门大街，你会发现它的东西两侧，在它的沿街店铺的背后，分别有一条小街。西边的称为珠宝市街和东边的被称为果子胡同。和前门大街平行。形成一个三条路平行的系统。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>说到这里，我想我无须多言。你已经懂了。（《日下旧闻考》 Zhu Yizun, 1687）</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  原始的前门大街，有60米宽。这很自然，天朝上国，大明国和大清国的皇帝去天坛祭天的道路。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  早在清朝后期，在前门大街上已经有很多临时的商业摊位，它们形成两条连续的窝棚，在晚清的老照片里你可以看到。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在老照片里，你也可以看到庚子国变平息之后，光绪帝和慈禧太后的仪仗从窝棚之间的通道回到紫禁城。虽然被窝棚占据，但是，中间的通路，仍然有30米宽，走人走车都是戳戳有余，后来甚至在上面通了有轨电车。经年累月，两列窝棚之间的道路，成了前门大街的主街。这些窝棚，逐渐反客为主，变成正式的店铺，入住了很多豪华的主力店；而原来大街的边缘，被窝棚搁在背后的部分反而成为小巷，以亲民的小店铺为主。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如上，东京浅草寺，威尼斯里亚尔托桥，北京前门大街，三个案例，可以被认为是同构的。
