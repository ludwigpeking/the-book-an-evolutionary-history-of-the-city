<p>
  Some surveys (such as Gallup Global Emotions Report ) stating that peoples may
  have more positive view toward their lives, even without higher income or
  longer life expectancy.
</p>

<p>
  This observation may contradict the conventional wisdom of our society, which
  largely values the pursuit of development and success. However, it's not
  particularly surprising when one considers that some African societies are
  culturally closer to hunter-gatherer traditions than societies in Europe,
  North America, or East Asia.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  In these societies, people gather tropical fruits from trees and hunt various
  animals. The men and women are strong and beautiful, full of the joy of
  physical activity. Their daily labor lasts no more than four hours, leaving
  ample time for singing and dancing. Life is lived without long-term plans,
  often planned no more than three days in advance. While illness and hunger are
  occasional problems, death, when it comes, is swift and suffering is
  short-lived.
</p>

<p>
  Max Weber once stated that workers from these hunter-gatherer societies would
  not work longer hours if their wages were increased. Rather, they would work
  fewer hours because they only intend to earn a certain amount of money. If
  their wages are doubled, they will work half as much and spend more time in
  leisure.
</p>

<p>
  Considering that 95% of the 2.5 million years of human history were spent in
  this way, it could be argued that human nature and our innate qualities were
  primarily shaped by this lifestyle. The ability to endure, plan for the long
  term, and nurture grand ambitions are comparatively recent cultural
  developments.
</p>

<p>
  We, the people of agricultural and industrial societies, measure
  hunter-gatherers by our standards, much like what Wang Guowei suggested: "we
  gauge the lives of these simpler folk using our own desires for status. We are
  often unaware that their desires for a fulfilling life have been better
  satisfied than ours. " Indeed, archaeological evidence suggests that the
  transition from the relatively healthy, happy, and leisurely lifestyle of
  hunting and gathering to engaging in agriculture was a forced act.
</p>

<p>
  The earliest evidence of humans collecting plant seeds to make flour-like food
  dates back to approximately 300,000 years ago, predating the appearance of
  Homo sapiens. However, a significant shift occurred about 12,000 years ago, a
  period known as the "Younger Dryas event," which was a mini ice age making the
  climate dry and cold. To secure a more stable food source, the ancient people
  in the Middle East, particularly in the Euphrates River Valley, had to depend
  on cultivated crops and their seeds for survival, thus marking the dawn of the
  Agricultural Age.
</p>

<p>
  Yuval Noah Harari, in his book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind," argued
  that humans took up agriculture to feed the tens of thousands of workers
  constructing the Tower of Babel.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless of which view one accepts, the fact remains that humans adopting
  agriculture is a relatively recent phenomenon. Before this, only the dead were
  settled. But now, to care for their crops, people had to become settled. As
  crops could only be harvested every few months, grain had to be stored in
  containers and granaries. This development led to settled villages, marked by
  grain silos, which combined with holy places, temples, or markets, eventually
  became larger human settlements, almost cities.
</p>

<p>
  The oldest cities appeared in the Levant, which is the western part of the
  Fertile Crescent, including modern-day Israel, Jordan, and Syria. One city,
  whose name is well known to us, is Jericho, which has a history of 11,500
  years.
</p>

<p>
  The discovery of a 10,000-year-old stone tower in Jericho has led some
  archaeologists, like Barkai from Tel Aviv University, to argue that the
  structure was likely designed to intimidate the local populace. It served as a
  constant reminder of their insignificance and encouraged respect and
  submission to the burdensome and tiresome lifestyle imposed by agricultural
  communes, along with the pressures of the social hierarchies in these new
  societies.
</p>

<p>
  Agriculture was indeed a distinct profession that dramatically altered human
  lifestyles. Humans, originally highly mobile creatures, became stationary with
  the onset of agriculture. They started to care for crops, developed an
  affinity for the land, and their lives became more monotonous, almost
  plant-like according to Spengler's perspective.
</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Who has the power?</strong></p>

<p>
  The advantage of being a farmer lies in their consistent and abundant food
  income. They owned houses and granaries, allowing them to store food and
  possess many private properties. They were able to sustain a consistent diet
  and enjoy a more predictable lifestyle in the short term. Hunter-gatherers, in
  contrast, led a nomadic life, eating irregularly, and all their possessions
  were only what they could carry.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, agriculture supports a much higher population density. As
  previously discussed, a square kilometer of grassland could not support even
  one hunter, but the same area of farmland can sustain hundreds of farmers.
</p>

<p>
  In modern conversations about net assets, profit margins, growth rates, etc.,
  farmers seem more successful than hunters, more akin to the "winners" of life.
  If life were a stock market, the farmers' stocks would be blue-chip, while
  hunters' would be considered junk stocks.
</p>

<p>
  However, this perspective is not necessarily accurate. Hunters, from a young
  age, were trained in archery and could kill almost instinctively. While
  farmers could be healthy and strong, they could hardly match the combat
  prowess of hunters. When farmers encountered hunters, they found themselves
  unable to protect their possessions or their lives. This cycle has been
  repeated throughout history.
</p>

<p>
  The term 'hunter' I use here is a broad one. They could be hunter-gatherer
  tribes, nomadic tribes, or any culture influenced by these lifestyles. For
  example, hunting game was a favorite pastime of English kings and Manchu
  emperors. These activities were not mere entertainment but serious training
  and even selection processes for successors and military commanders. This can
  be considered a cultural legacy passed down from their barbarian ancestors,
  making them broadly defined 'hunters'.
</p>

<p>
  Though the hunter populations were often small, they were, in many ways, the
  protagonists of history. In the late Roman Empire, the Roman legions were
  powerless against the invading Germanic tribes. The empire relied on Franks,
  early Germanic immigrants, to defend it as they were more martial than the
  agricultural Latin people. The Byzantine Empire relied on Varangian warriors,
  or Vikings, to fend off attacks from various Turkic, Avar, and Bulgarian
  nomadic tribes.
</p>

<p>
  The Sui and Tang Dynasties, according to their official accounts, originated
  from Wuchuan, north of Yinshan in Inner Mongolia, which was not an
  agricultural area. The Li family, founders of the Tang dynasty, were skilled
  horsemen and warriors. However, by their fifth generation, Emperor Tang Ming
  Huang, the martial spirit of the family had faded, and they became more
  artistic. The military responsibility is mostly on generals and regional
  commanders who were non-Han people, and when facing internal challenges
  provoked by these 'barbarian generals', the court recruited other barbarian
  generals from the western frontier to quell the unrest.
</p>

<p>
  At the turn of the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was no different. Dorgon's
  Manchu Banner Men, traditionally hunters, were only forty to fifty thousand
  strong, crushed the Ming empire with a peasant population over a hundred
  millions.
</p>

<p>
  Farmers were extremely vulnerable when faced with the formidable hunters. The
  hunters had the potential to slaughter the farmers. This situation, much like
  the Mongol conquests of the middle asia, indeed had occurred.
</p>

<p>
  But the slaughter of farmers was not necessarily the most advantageous for
  hunters. Replacing farmers and occupying their land offered little gain to the
  hunters' way of life. However, if the hunters left the farmers alone and
  collected protection fees from them, a stable source of long-term income would
  form. From the farmers' perspective, paying the hunters protection fees in
  exchange for their protection, and being spared from the slaughter by other
  hunter tribes, was a viable option.
</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Protectors and Proctectees</strong></p>

<p>
  This brings us to the main point of this section. A symbiotic relationship
  often forms between hunters and farmers. A relationship between protectors and
  those being protected. The relationship between sellers and buyers of martial
  power. They are the two sides of a typical symbiosis in city states.
</p>

<p>
  Once hunters enter this symbiotic mode, they transform into warriors and
  nobles, the higher ranks of urban society.
</p>

<p>
  Different situations lead to different interactions between hunters and
  farmers, between sellers and buyers of martial power.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Hired Warriors: Sometimes, the hunters find themselves in the position of
    guest armies, unable to suppress the farmers. At these times they are like
    mercenary guards, similar to the Varangian Guards. Moreover, this
    interactive relationship can be reversed. This is exemplified by the
    Mamluks, who started as guards and ended up rulers of Egypt; or by Francesco
    Sforza, a mercenary captain who became the Duke of Milan.
  </li>

  <li>
    Allied: the Crusaders was initially an ally of the Byzantines. But became
    invited conquerors.
  </li>

  <li>
    Invasive: in most of the other cases., when hunters have the upper hand in
    this symbiotic relationship, they are military colonists, and the farmers
    are the conquered;
  </li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p>
  When they form a relatively harmonious and stable community with the farmers,
  they are seen as the relationship between the warrior nobility and civilian
  tenants.
</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>High Tension</strong></p>

<p>
  The symbiotic relationship between hunters and farmers inherently carries
  strong tensions.
</p>

<p>
  The Spartans of ancient Greece were believed to be very inhumane towards their
  slaves, who were called Helots.
</p>

<p>
  Helots' daily task was to farm for the Spartans. But their situation seemed
  even worse than that of ordinary slaves. According to Herodotus, the
  population of the Helots was seven times that of the Spartans. One can imagine
  that if they were organized, even if they were just using farming tools, they
  would pose a significant threat to the Spartans.
</p>

<p>
  Each year, the Spartans would conduct a purge, killing any influential or
  brave Helots who might become leaders. They had to ensure that the Helot
  community remained leaderless and scattered, absolutely devoid of any
  organization.
</p>

<p>
  Generally speaking, systematic violence within a society would lead to its
  moral collapse.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, this phenomenon cannot be understood with the logic of internal
  relations within the community. Prior to classical Greek times, in 12th
  century BC the Dorians invaded the Peloponnese from the north. The Spartans
  were a branch of them. In other words, the Spartans were foreign hunters,
  military conquerors. The Helots, on the other hand, were native Greeks. They
  came from different communities. Furthermore, the Spartans did not work on
  integrating themselves into the local society, and did not let the Helots
  engage in service industries that required close cooperation with the rulers.
  They were treated purely as an economic resource.
</p>

<p>
  This highly tense form of symbiosis is indeed special, but not necessarily
  unique. The rulers of the Yin Shang dynasty liked to use living human
  sacrifices. Thousands of human sacrificial bones were unearthed from the Yin
  Ruins. The Shang people conducted hunting activities, and their hunting
  targets included alien humans who lived outside their colonies. These
  activities could not only be a kind of sacrificial activity or pure hunting
  entertainment. The nature of population control and economic exploitation of
  the conquered people could be seen, which seemed to echo the relationship
  between the Spartans and the Helots.
</p>

<p>
  The Varna caste system of ancient India consists of three primary castes. The
  first, Brahmin, are the priests and ideological administrators. The second,
  Kshatriya, are warriors and nobles. According to the Aryan theory, these two
  castes are descendants of the Eurasian steppe-originated invaders, who had a
  custom of worshipping cows, hence broadly descendants of hunters. The
  so-called Aryan descendants may not be bloodline descendants, but they are, at
  the very least, political and professional successors. They conquered the
  Indus River Valley and placed the native agricultural population under their
  rule.
</p>

<p>
  The third caste, Vaishya, is made up of agricultural, commercial, and
  artisanal citizens. Their origin is either at the periphery of hunter groups,
  joining the hunter community earlier than the natives, or they are the
  mixed-race offspring of hunters and locals. In any case, they are the united
  front targets of the conquerors.
</p>

<p>
  The fourth caste, Shudra, are the descendants of the conquered native
  agricultural population of the Indus Valley. They lack citizenship and do not
  undergo rites of passage.
</p>

<p>
  These castes display a clear symbiotic relationship between hunters and
  farmers. However, the potential for unification and integration between
  hunters and farmers is also evident. In many modern societies, after several
  generations or dozens of generations of vertical integration, the descendants
  of hunters and farmers have mostly integrated. But this kind of integrated
  society of warriors and civilians, appearing homogenous and static, is
  actually a temporary state in history; the existence of foreign order, the
  hierarchical differences between warriors and civilians, the symbiosis within
  opposition, and the dynamic evolution between each other, are more typical
  over larger timescales.
</p>

<p>
  In cities worldwide, traces of this class-based symbiotic opposition are
  remarkably apparent. The most common form is the castle.
</p>

<p>
  Castles, often regarded as possessing romantic qualities, are associated with
  noble morals and lifestyle. Yet, did you know that in most cultures, the
  ancestors of the nobility were barbarians, or hunters? The symbiosis of
  hunters and farmers, as rulers or protectors of the farmers, led to their
  settlement among the farmers.
</p>

<p>
  Despite their superior military ability, hunters were few in number, perhaps
  only one-tenth or one-hundredth of the farmers. Hence, they had to first
  protect themselves from potential retaliation from their protectees, the local
  farmers.
</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The Protagonist</strong></p>

<p>
  In England, there are numerous castles, many of which were built during the
  Norman Conquest. The Normans fought their way through but, to effectively rule
  a large country with their mere tens of thousands of knights, they built
  castles wherever they conquered. Between 1066 and 1087, the Norman conquerors
  built 36 castles in central England.
</p>

<p>
  The Manchu Qing dynasty entered the pass with tens of thousands of Eight
  Banners soldiers to rule hundreds of millions of Ming people. The Eight
  Banners troops were not spread out like pepper powder. Within the great wall,
  there were seven garrisons in Jiangning, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Jingzhou, Xi'an,
  Chengdu, and Guangzhou, each with several thousand soldiers. Apart from these
  seven, there were more than a dozen other locations with Eight Banners
  garrisons. They generally had an independent enclave, called Manchu City,
  Tartarian City or Banner City.
</p>

<p>
  Manchu City, the fortress of the hunters. In the context of the continuous
  settlements of farmers, it forms several isolated islands. Similar to the
  warrior nobility of many cultures throughout history, they form a fortified
  area in or near civilian cities. These Manchu Cities were the primary bases of
  Qing rule. Moreover, during times of war or revolution, such as the Taiping
  Rebellion and the Xinhai Revolution, these Manchu Cities were crucial. For
  example, the Manchu Eight Banners in Nanjing resisted the Taiping Rebellion in
  a scorched-earth defense, sacrificing themselves for the honor of their race .
</p>

<p>
  The symbiosis of hunters and farmers can almost be directly equated with
  "colonialism," seemingly full of contradictions and tension. However, this
  symbiotic relationship exhibits great vitality. Moreover, it is not only the
  main form of the initial origins of cities but also the precursor of many of
  today's world cities. The Tower of London, for instance, is the fortress from
  which the Normans ruled the native English. The Jin Dynastry Peking, or
  Khanbaliq, is clearly the outpost set up by the nomadic tribes in the
  agricultural areas at the foot of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
  That is to say, this kind of symbiotic relationship has become the protagonist
  of the evolutionary system. This precisely indicates that this symbiotic
  relationship possesses elements of order and organization, efficiency
  advantages, and the ability for sustainable development.
</p>

<p>
  As this series unfolds, I hope to further elaborate on these relationships.
</p>
