<h1>24 Suburban Shopping Center - the development of the Typology</h1>

<p>
  Major cities in China are swiftly transitioning into the automotive suburban
  era. However, many professionals in the field have yet to grasp the
  intricacies of this transformation. In this edition, I invite you to explore
  the United States, with its century-long history of automotive evolution,
  specifically focusing on the landscape of shopping malls. Many patterns we
  observe are universally applicable, underscoring the global nature of certain
  phenomena. At the heart of my exploration lies the concept that shopping
  centers in the car era are fundamentally designed around automotive transport,
  distinguishing them from traditional urban commercial districts.
</p>

<p>But, a brief digression first.</p>

<p>
  The term for shopping centers in English is "Shopping Mall" or "Shopping
  Center."
</p>

<p>
  Originally, "Mall" referred to a grassy area where people would stroll and
  partake in games similar to croquet. It symbolized an open space for outdoor
  activities. For instance, the vast lawn situated between the White House and
  the Capitol in Washington D.C., where presidential inaugurations are held, is
  named the "National Mall" – essentially meaning "National Lawn" and certainly
  not implying a national shopping center. The green space in downtown Cleveland
  is also referred to as "the Mall," and humorously, in a particular source, it
  was mistakenly translated to "shopping center." A minor amusing note on the
  side.
</p>

<p>
  Such "Mall" green spaces often hosted market fairs during holidays, bustling
  with stalls selling various items and entertainment activities, emanating a
  natural, cheerful, and lively ambiance.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, when Americans began using the term "mall" to denote suburban
  shopping centers, it was a clever and evocative choice of branding. The
  contemporary shopping mall encapsulates this essence—a vast sheltered space,
  perpetually spring-like, linking numerous stores, with people bustling about.
  This is the archetype embodied by shopping centers like Wanda Plaza.
</p>

<p>
  However, let's not get entrenched in one view. We face three pertinent
  questions: Firstly, in the US, where most shoppers arrive by car, why compel
  them to walk through such communal spaces when they could drive directly to
  their desired store? Secondly, wouldn’t it be more effective to have store
  fronts visible directly from the highways, instead of tucked inside malls? And
  thirdly, wouldn’t forgoing the construction and maintenance of this
  ever-spring communal space be a cost-saving measure without causing any harm?
</p>

<p>
  In reality, while the classic Wanda Plaza-style shopping centers do exist in
  the US, a more prevalent version is the following:
</p>

<p>
  Adjacent to highways is a rectangular parking lot, accommodating anywhere from
  dozens to thousands of vehicles. Lining the parking lot is a continuous strip
  of conspicuous stores, big and small, predominantly franchises—very grounded
  and relatable. In English, this type of shopping center is termed a "strip
  mall." Surprisingly, there's no direct Chinese translation for this term. A
  whimsical attempt using Google Translate amusingly rendered it as "strip dance
  shopping center." A word of caution: when in the US, don’t let such
  translations mislead you into misguided explorations. "Strip mall" literally
  and figuratively means a "linear shopping center."
</p>

<p>
  As reported by the New York Times' Kramer, Andrew E., in 2013, the US had a
  total of 65,840 strip malls.
</p>

<p>
  One can only imagine the numerous developments and evolutions based on this
  archetype. It truly stands as the mother of shopping centers in the automotive
  age.
</p>

<p>
  1) The fundamental components of suburban malls in the automobile era are the
  shopping center and parking spaces. The shopping center usually occupies about
  40% of the land, while parking and driveways consume 60%.
</p>

<p>
  Typically, these shopping centers are just one story tall. Why not build them
  with two stories? Because it's simply not worth the additional cost.
  Constructing two floors might have similar costs per square foot as one floor,
  but the revenue or rent from the second floor would be much lower.
  Furthermore, with a single-story design, you can achieve over 90% utilization
  of the floor space. Add another story, and you'll need elevators and
  staircases, dropping that utilization below 80%. Therefore, from a return on
  investment perspective, it's best to stick to a single story when working
  within a limited budget.
</p>

<p>
  Then comes the parking lot. The area it occupies is usually slightly larger
  than the shopping center's built-up area. This may sound excessive, but for
  suburban malls, the key is to have convenient parking. Within the city,
  several similar malls are just a short drive away, sometimes less than 10
  minutes. If parking isn't easy at your mall, customers will simply go
  elsewhere. These vast parking spaces aren't only for everyday use; they're
  primarily designed for weekend peaks. On holidays, these lots might be 95%
  full. On weekdays, if 40% is occupied, that's a good day, with many spaces
  empty. Is that wasteful? Not at all. If you can't accommodate the rush on peak
  days, you'll eventually lose that rush altogether. During peak mall times,
  assume 10 customers per 100 square meters—a moderate density. With every two
  customers typically arriving in one car and each car occupying 28 square
  meters, every 100 square meters of retail space demands 140 square meters for
  parking. This is the reality of the automotive age.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, a few malls can evolve into high-density formats, expanding to
  include new stores, adding floors, and even incorporating office or
  residential buildings. These malls will develop over their once expansive
  parking lots, turning some into multi-story parking garages, increasing the
  overall site density. Hence, these vast parking areas serve as potential
  development zones for suburban malls, even if most never undergo this
  transformation.
</p>

<p>
  2) The location for automotive suburban shopping centers must be at major road
  intersections. These roads offer 1) Accessibility and 2) Visibility. Both are
  self-explanatory, so there's no need for further elaboration.
</p>

<p>
  Typically, these malls are near exits where two or three highways intersect.
  Their value doesn't primarily depend on their proximity to the city center but
  on the volume of traffic on the main roads. Taking IKEA in Beijing as an
  example: the first location is at the intersection of the North Third Ring and
  the Beijing-Tibet Expressway. The second is near the intersection of the
  Northeast Fourth Ring and the Airport Expressway, not far from the
  Beijing-Chengde Expressway. As you can observe, each location is at the
  intersection of two major traffic arteries. Moreover, they are gradually
  moving outward because ring roads offer faster mobility than crossing the
  city, potentially attracting a larger, more dense population.
</p>

<p>
  Washington D.C.'s Beltway 495 is roughly the size of Beijing's Fifth Ring.
  Most of D.C.'s large suburban businesses are scattered along it.
</p>

<p>
  Using the Average Daily Traffic (ADT), I broadly categorize roads into three
  levels: major arterials with around 100,000 vehicles, primary roads with about
  30,000, and secondary roads with roughly 10,000. These roads intersect in
  various combinations, each corresponding to a type of suburban mall, with
  deviations within half an order of magnitude.

<p>
  The largest intersections, formed by two major arterial roads, can be found in
  first-tier cities with perhaps a dozen instances. In second-tier cities, there
  might be just a few, while in third-tier cities, there might be one or even
  none at all. Such intersections are prime locations for expansive shopping
  centers that span over 80,000 square meters and can be categorized as
  super-regional hubs.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The second category is the intersection of a major arterial road and a
    standard main road. These types of intersections are particularly abundant
    in first-tier cities. In contrast, they're relatively rare and therefore
    more valuable in second-tier cities, which might use such locations to
    establish integrated regional shopping centers ranging between 40,000 and
    80,000 square meters. In first-tier cities, these intersections may not have
    as distinct an advantage. Instead, they could serve niche markets with
    specialized shopping centers that house flagship stores of big brands like
    Walmart and Metro, or even power centers and factory outlets. These could
    also be thematic or industry-segregated commercial clusters.
  </li>

  <li>
    The third category is the confluence of a major arterial road with a
    secondary main road. In metropolises, these are quite common and thus might
    not be deemed as crucial, often overshadowed by larger intersections nearby,
    making their prominence relatively minor.
  </li>

  <li>
    Next, we have intersections of two standard main roads, both witnessing
    daily traffic around the 30,000 mark. In large cities, these locations
    typically host sub-regional commercial hubs, suitable for commercial spaces
    between 10,000 and 40,000 square meters that may offer a diverse mix of
    specialty shops. However, in cities below the third-tier, such intersections
    could be among the busiest, potentially serving as larger, city-wide
    shopping centers. I recall Ann Arbor in Michigan resonating with this
    scenario.
  </li>

  <li>
    Descending a level, we have intersections between a standard main road and a
    minor main road. These typically host neighborhood business centers
    comprising supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, and
    restaurants. In the U.S., Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) locations,
    which Americans visit more frequently than places like IKEA, can also be key
    anchors in such settings.
  </li>

  <li>
    At the smallest scale, intersections of two minor main roads in the U.S.
    generally give rise to convenience hubs under 2,500 square meters. These
    might include a mini-market, gas station, laundromat, a couple of small
    eateries, and a barbershop – arranged more casually.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Collaborative Corners</strong></p>

<p>
  Since I've mentioned intersections, whether they are overpasses or at-grade
  intersections, there will always be four corners. In urban commercial
  districts, these corners often host several shopping malls, forming a
  symbiotic ensemble. However, in suburban areas dominated by cars,
  collaboration between these corners is typically weak. This is because the
  space is expansive with broad roads and often intricate cloverleaf
  interchanges. Walking from one corner to another can be tedious, especially
  when carrying a significant amount of shopping. Parking is also conveniently
  abundant. Thus, people would likely drive from Mall A on one corner to Mall B
  on another, even if it's a short distance. As I mentioned earlier, once you're
  behind the wheel, whether the destination is across the street or five
  kilometers away, the distinction diminishes. As a result, the four corners of
  a suburban intersection often sadly operate in isolation, with one corner
  potentially dominating the others.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >3) Evolutionary Directions and Differentiation Strategies for Suburban
    Shopping Centers</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  The most fundamental and iconic is the symbiotic relationship between anchor
  stores and smaller retailers. An anchor store, typically drawing large crowds,
  can be a department store, a large supermarket, a big specialty shop, or a
  luxury outlet. A shopping center might have two to three of these. Nestled
  between them are many smaller shops. While anchor stores might occupy only 40%
  of the shopping center's total area, they could contribute to 60% of sales.
  Interestingly, their rent might only be 20% of the total. Essentially, anchor
  stores drive foot traffic for the smaller shops, while the smaller shops
  shoulder a greater rent burden. Anchor stores represent the dominant entities
  in this ecosystem, while the smaller shops play a nurturing role. This
  configuration can be considered a basic model.
</p>

<p>
  Another format is the Power Center, characterized by a series of anchor stores
  lined up side by side. Shoppers can efficiently move from one store to
  another. This setup, a specialized form of the strip mall, emphasizes shopping
  efficiency and caters to non-personalized consumption, typically at mid to
  low-end price points. From another perspective, it showcases the diverse
  offerings and in-depth services within these chain anchor stores.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, there's the upscale, refined direction. Given the gradual rise in
  Americans' living standards (excluding inflation, which doubles every 20
  years), commercial entities need to keep pace with the evolving demands of
  this increasingly affluent populace. Enhancing spatial quality and emphasizing
  experience become paramount.
</p>

<p>
  Within this direction, two phenomenal forms emerge: First, the Lifestyle
  Center emphasizes outdoor space experiences and elevates the proportion of
  dining options. Second, the City Center, while literally translating to "urban
  core", aims to recapture the charm of historical downtowns. It's larger in
  scale, more diverse in its offerings, and often features multi-tiered spatial
  configurations, including squares, lawns, urban parks, and outdoor
  recreational facilities. These centers, leaning into the "experience", are
  more prevalent in warmer regions, though they exist in the north as well.
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, there's a trend towards high-density, urban-like redevelopment.
  Multi-storied malls incorporate high-rise offices, parking structures, and
  even apartments. They often leverage the connectivity of subways or trams to
  reduce reliance on parking and optimize space usage. The end result resembles
  traditional urban environments.
