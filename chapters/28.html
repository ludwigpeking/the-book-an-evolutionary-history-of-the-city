<h1>28 Informal Occupation - Reflets Better the Underlying Orders</h1>

<p>
  In this chapter, we discuss the concept of "informal occupation". But what is
  informal occupation?
</p>

<p><strong>A Natural Process or Pareto Improvement</strong></p>

<p>
  Let's consider a real-life example. A couple moves into a new home, which has
  a large wardrobe. They each hang their clothes in the wardrobe: the husband on
  the left half, and the wife on the right. Initially, they seem to have an
  unspoken agreement to split the space evenly. However, as time passes, the
  wife's collection of clothes grows, filling her half and slowly encroaching on
  the husband's space. The husband doesn't mind, as he doesn't have as many
  clothes. Eventually, when he buys new winter clothes and runs out of space, he
  spots some room on top of the wardrobe. He neatly folds some of his clothes,
  places them in boxes, and stacks them up there. Initially, they had an
  unspoken rule: half the space for each. Yet, this boundary was silently
  breached. The wife crossed the middle line, and the husband claimed the top.
  All of this happened without any formal agreement. This is a perfect example
  of informal occupation.
</p>

<p>
  In the early days of human urbanization, there were no land certificates or
  clear boundaries of ownership. Land was abundant, and it was typically "first
  come, first served." Each household had just a small hut, and as long as they
  didn't block pathways or cause inconvenience, everything was fine. However, as
  population and wealth grew, households began to expand their possessions,
  building pens for sheep outside their homes or stacking grain and firewood.
  Those with a higher status in the community or those with more resources and
  larger families would have more say and would tend to occupy more land or
  better spots. All these occupations were informal. There were no set rules.
  But gradually, public spaces between huts began to feel the pressure, and
  ambiguous boundaries led to internal conflicts. At this point, establishing
  clear ownership became crucial.
</p>

<p>
  The ancient text "Lüshi Chunqiu" mentions, "In a forest, a rabbit runs, a
  hundred men chase it, because this rabbit has no owner. In a marketplace
  filled with rabbits, passersby won't even give them a second glance, not
  because they don't want rabbits, but because these rabbits already have
  owners." Ambiguous ownership leads to competition, and competition consumes
  vast resources. Thus, structures like fences and walls began to appear. They
  might not offer effective defense but served as markers of property claims. If
  these claims did not infringe on others' rights and went unchallenged, they
  eventually became more formalized. Informal occupation can thus be seen as the
  precursor to property rights, emerging from the interactions and contests of
  this phase.
</p>

<p>
  Even the streets of traditional cities are a result of informal occupation.
  People would claim land alongside roads, building as close to the streets as
  possible to assert their boundaries. Yet, there's a limit – they couldn't
  obstruct traffic. Everyone tends to push this boundary as much as possible
  without infringing on the broader public interest. As a result, you get
  orderly, continuous rows of buildings right up against their plot boundaries,
  hugging the streets. Traditional cities didn't have gardens opening onto
  streets since it wasn't conducive for stable occupation.
</p>

<p>
  While streets were left unoccupied to avoid public outrage, airspace above
  them was often fair game. Overhangs from second floors jutted out further than
  those on the first, creating additional space. This behavior was tolerated in
  many cities and is especially common in early commercial settlements like in
  Italy and the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
  In the rainy cities of Southeast Asia, these overhangs, which offer shelter
  from rain, are very beneficial for commercial streets. Some overhang so much
  that they require columns on the streets, becoming colonades. originating in
  India and Singapore. They're popular architectural features in cities like
  Guangzhou and Xiamen.
</p>

<p>
  In terms of informal occupation, the game rules still apply. Whoever creates
  more value has a better chance to dominate. If the husband leaves his space in
  the wardrobe unused, not creating any value, the wife might stuff her clothes
  into it, putting the space to good use. By the time she occupies the wardrobe,
  she has established a status quo. If the husband protests, he would infringe
  on the wife's interests, resulting in her resistance. Regaining his original
  equal space in the wardrobe becomes a challenge. Therefore, changing an
  established fact often comes at a cost, sometimes quite high. A more
  cost-effective alternative might be to just occupy the top part of the
  wardrobe and make concessions.
</p>

<p>
  In Nepal, there are instances where residents without homes occupy public
  green spaces, setting up prefabricated houses. In Beijing, "Da Zayuan" (*<em>
    is a type of residential environment in Beijing, a representation of how
    historical urban areas adapted to accommodate increasing populations and
    changing social structures.)</em
  >
  represents residents who informally occupy public courtyards to build private
  homes. These are cases of informal occupation. In such scenarios, the
  authorities have the right to dismantle these structures to restore the public
  land. However, evicting these residents might render them homeless. Should the
  authorities then provide temporary housing? If the husband evicts his wife's
  clothes from the wardrobe, doesn't he still need to buy a new one? Doesn't
  that come with its own costs?
</p>

<p>
  If the authorities lack the resources to intervene, they might tolerate this
  informal occupation. The longer the wife occupies the wardrobe, the more
  justified it seems. Later, when their child grows up, having always seen the
  wardrobe predominantly filled with the mother's clothes, the child will
  naturally assume it's the mother's. If earlier generations don't challenge
  these occupations, the chance for subsequent generations to challenge
  diminishes. Informal occupation, when passed down generations, is more likely
  to become semi-formal, perhaps even officially recognized. From an economic
  standpoint, if such occupation doesn't infringe on (or seriously harm) others'
  rights and creates well-being for the occupier, isn't it a kind of Pareto
  improvement?

<p><strong>New Orders Rise from the Void </strong></p>

<p>
  During the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, a population decline resulted in a
  large amount of unused land. Essentially, whoever cultivated it, owned it. As
  for the Roman Empire in its later stages, amidst upheaval, many properties and
  streets were abandoned. Roads that were once meticulously planned and broad
  became redundant. Residents expanded their homes onto these streets, leaving
  just enough width for passage. As a result, roads became winding and twisted.
  Some properties remained unclaimed, and buildings collapsed, allowing new
  paths to be formed across vacant plots. Streets unused by anyone could be
  completely occupied, or even merged with properties across the road. Public
  buildings managed by the government, such as the Baths of Nero, became
  dilapidated as their materials were stolen to construct private homes, leading
  to their gradual disappearance. Theaters and arenas with sturdy structures
  often saw their underground spaces divided and occupied by homeless families.
  Squatter houses began to appear in squares. After the fall of the Empire, with
  the collapse of administrative systems and authority, a state of anarchy
  prevailed, and informal occupation became rampant.
</p>

<p>
  To formalize these occupations isn't a challenge. Cities and feudal lords need
  to collect taxes, and before doing so, they would organize property
  registration. As long as no disputes arise during this process, these informal
  occupations can easily become official, much like children born out of the
  official population policy getting registered during a census. Once you have
  the deed, you can treat the property as inherited and develop it further. Over
  a prolonged period, a new order emerges from the chaos of the old empire.
  Nomads form guilds and free city-states, and descendants of refugees become
  bourgeoisie. Haphazardly built structures evolve into works of art over
  centuries. For example, theaters by the Tiber River in Rome, once divided
  among many families, now comprise luxurious residences, retaining their
  circular facade. Though, like the Ship of Theseus, most bricks aren't original
  anymore. These residences now even feature elevators. Observing this
  miraculous rebirth always leaves me profoundly moved. Informal occupation
  plays a significant role in human settlements, occasionally acting as a
  pivotal element. While informal occupations come with controversies and
  disputes, they aren't as dreadful as imagined. They are generally based on
  mutual respect and the broader public interest, ensuring the game isn't pushed
  too far.

  The most intense and unequal occupations are conducted through force and
  authority – these are conquests. Both formal and informal occupations are
  highly vulnerable in the face of conquerors.

  Now, a question for the readers: Will Elon Musk's colony on Mars also begin
  with informal occupation?
