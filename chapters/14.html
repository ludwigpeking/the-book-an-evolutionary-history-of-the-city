</p>

<p>
  In our previous discussion, we touched upon the golden era of trade routes
  across the Eurasian steppes during the medieval period.
</p>

<p><strong>Canals</strong></p>

<p>
  During this era, maritime and riverine navigation continued uninterrupted.
  Especially noteworthy were the canals. A single mule could carry around 120
  kilograms. Where roads existed, carts could be used, with a single cart
  capable of transporting over 600 kilograms. However, on water, one horse, when
  pulling a towpath, could drag a barge with a payload of up to 30 tons. This is
  50 times more efficient than cart transportation.
</p>

<p>
  Typically, canals weren't entirely man-made from start to finish. Instead,
  they often utilized natural waterways wherever possible. When a natural river
  had segments with steep gradients, making upstream navigation impossible,
  canals could employ locks, functioning much like elevators, to elevate boats.
  This was one of the advantages of canals. Another characteristic of canals was
  the unstable water levels at the junctions of different basins. Some sections
  might lack water, rendering transportation impossible. In such situations,
  goods, often grains, would be offloaded and stored until water levels rose,
  making transportation feasible again.
</p>

<p>
  The Grand Canal, spanning from Beijing to Hangzhou, stands as the longest in
  history and was the most crucial canal in the ancient world. The canal, during
  the Sui Dynasty, originated in Kaifeng. Following the course of the Bian
  River, it passed through the Huai and Yangtze rivers, reaching all the way to
  Hangzhou. It transported a myriad of goods, primarily channeling the grain
  from the Suzhou-Hangzhou region to Kaifeng, and further to Luoyang or Chang'an
  to sustain the vast population of the capital region. As we can observe, the
  capitals of the Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties gradually moved southeast along
  the canal, shifting from Chang'an to Luoyang, then to Kaifeng, and
  occasionally even relocating to Yangzhou. This shift shortened transport
  routes, reduced transportation costs, and was driven by the dynasties'
  strategic imperatives.
</p>

<p>
  During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the primary role of the canal was
  to transport grains from the southern regions to Beijing. Thus, the route was
  adjusted to a more direct path, bypassing Kaifeng and instead passing through
  Shandong.
</p>

<p>
  In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the canal functioned like a highway within the
  empire or could be viewed as the empire's technological artery. Along the
  canal, major northern commercial cities emerged, from north to south,
  including Tongzhou, Tianjin, Cangzhou, Linqing (the backdrop for the story
  "Jin Ping Mei"), Xuzhou, Huai'an , and Yangzhou.
</p>

<p>
  Tolls collected from the canal constituted a significant portion of the
  empire's fiscal revenue. The professional managers overseeing this revenue
  formed a distinct societal class.
</p>

<p>
  When police investigate criminal cases, by observing the modus operandi, they
  can determine the county the perpetrator hails from, reflecting the
  continuation of certain techniques across generations. During the Middle Ages,
  from Italy to Poland, and from the Middle East's Baghdad to Samarkand, the
  majority involved in commerce and finance activites in the cites were Jews.
  They constituted a significant portion of the urban population. The major
  medieval city of Kaifeng even had a Jewish community. Similar to the Jews,
  Armenians were widespread across the Near East and Middle East, often forming
  Christian business communities. During the era of the Republic of China,
  Harbin had a sizable Armenian community. In medieval South Asia and Southeast
  Asia, Muslims dominated the merchant class, and many cities had Muslim
  communities, though they were less prevalent in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
  At each of the toll stations along the Grand Canal of China, the professionals
  managing the revenue and taxation often hailed from Shaoxing, known as
  "Shaoxing Shiyi (clerks from Shaoxing)." When they moved to other regions,
  they would be termed as "Cangzhou Shiyi" or other similar titles, based on
  their new location. Zhou Enlai's ancestors were among the Shaoxing Shiyi,
  managing the toll stations in Huai'an. In his youth, Zhou went to Tianjin for
  his studies. If one understands the significance of the Grand Canal, they'd
  recognize that such patterns of movement weren't random.
</p>

<p>
  Northern Chinese traditional dishes aren't highly regarded, while Huaiyang
  cuisine is quite acclaimed. Along the Grand Canal, between the two, lies the
  cuisine of Shandong, or "Lu Cai." Lu Cai outstands from the northern cuisins,
  and Beijing cuisine is largely its descendant. These culinary styles spread
  along the canal. Similarly, Peking Opera, or "Jingju," evolved as a result of
  southern opera troupes moving to and developing in Beijing.
</p>

<p>
  Canals served as efficient conduits in the Middle Ages but with conditions.
  Their upkeep demanded the resources of vast empires. The consumption and
  extraction they facilitated might often overshadow their production value.
  This feature was especially pronounced in China. A declined empire loses its
  ability to sustain the functionality of the Grand Canal.
</p>

<p>
  Canals were an efficient medieval conductor of branch lines. It needs the
  maintenance of a great empire. And his absorbability and consumption may be
  greater than productivity. Its dimension is more prominent in China.
</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Modern Maritime Trade Era</strong></p>

<p>
  Let's return to the overarching narrative. The golden age of cavalry saw the
  rise of powerful empires like the Göktürks Khaganate and Mongol Empire, as
  well as prosperous inland trade routes.
</p>

<p>
  However, the emergence of another mode of transportation was undermining the
  foundations of these Inner Asian Empires' success. During the Middle Ages,
  while horsemen dominated the continents, seafaring was still slowly evolving.
  The deep-sea navigation abilities of the Middle Ages are often overlooked.
  This isn't to say that long-distance sea voyages did not exist; they were
  simply high-risk.
</p>

<p>
  When the Eastern Jin Dynasty Chinese monk, Faxian, traveled to India, he
  traversed the Pamir Plateau on foot. But on his return to the Eastern Asia, he
  sailed from Bengal, passed through Sri Lanka, and arrived in Java. From Java,
  he set off for the Chinese coast. He initially aimed for Canton but was blown
  off course to the Shandong Peninsula. Faxian wasn't a sailor; he learned
  during his travels along the Ganges that maritime routes were more convenient
  for returning trip. The sea routes he traveled were well-established by then.
  This implies that these maritime trade routes always existed but were not
  documented by intellectuals like Faxian before.
</p>

<p>
  Another monk from the Tang Dynasty, Yijing, traveled directly by boat, passing
  through Sumatra to reach India.
</p>

<p>
  The Sinbad voyages tell tales of medieval Arab traders sailing the Indian
  Ocean. In reality, these Arab traders had an expansive range of activities,
  reaching the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia.
</p>

<p>
  Huang Daopo learned advanced cotton spinning techniques in Hainan Island.
  Though some sources say she learned from the indigenous Li people, it's
  evident that she learned from workers involved in widespread commodity
  circulation, rather than from hunter-gatherer tribes. Recent archaeological
  discoveries in Hainan indicate the presence of medieval Muslim towns and
  burial sites. Cotton and cotton spinning technology originated in India and
  the Middle East. Huang Daopo likely learned these techniques from Muslim
  traders in Hainan's commercial towns. By the Tang Dynasty, Muslims were
  already active in Canton. By the Song and Yuan Dynasties, in major maritime
  trade cities like Quanzhou (or Cayton), the community leader was a Sunni
  Muslim named "Pu Shougeng(蒲寿庚)", whose original name can be speculated as
  Abu Sayyid Khan. Yuan army garrisons had 3,000 Shiite Muslims. Besides
  Muslims, there were also Jewish merchants and various Christian sects,
  including the Franciscans. Huang Daopo's story is essentially about a young
  woman from Shanghai who traveled south for work, acquired skills, and returned
  home to become wealthy. The narrative suggesting she learned from the Li
  mountain tribes is highly questionable.
</p>

<p>
  Zheng He, too, is part of this tradition. As is well known, Zheng He was a
  Muslim, and his father had been to Mecca. His position as fleet commander was
  related to his background, language skills, and social resources. The places
  his fleet reached, like the Red Sea and Mombasa in East Africa, might have
  been unfamiliar to the Ming emperor but were well-traversed routes for Zheng
  He's original community.
</p>

<p>
  All these were precursors to the Age of Exploration. The spread of technology
  due to maritime advancements began to outpace that of the continents. The
  phenomenon of Wokou (Japanese pirates) is a late manifestation of this trend.
</p>

<p><strong>The Age of Sails</strong></p>

<p>
  The ultimate breakthrough was a new type of ship, the caravel, invented by the
  Portuguese. This sleek ship, along with its upgraded version, the carrack, was
  transformative.
</p>

<p>
  The Portuguese were not accidental innovators. Portugal emerged from the
  Reconquista, the medieval Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from
  the Muslims. As the westernmost European nation, all its coastlines face the
  treacherous high seas of Atlantic. Deep-sea fishing was almost an inevitable
  industry. Moreover, Portugal could assimilate both European and Arab maritime
  technologies from the Mediterranean region.
</p>

<p>
  The new Portuguese long-distance ships had advantages over previous coastal
  trading vessels:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Their hulls were higher, better able to withstand waves, enhancing their
    reliability.
  </li>

  <li>They could sail across oceans.</li>

  <li>
    They relied solely on sails, eliminating the need for numerous rowers and
    reducing supply burdens.
  </li>

  <li>
    They could sail against the wind, a critical ability on Africa's west coast,
    where winds blow consistently in one direction.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Skipping over a detailed exposition, let's summarize the results: With the
  advent of the Age of Sails, maritime technology dissemination outstripped that
  of the continents. According to my theory of resistance, oceanic resistance
  decreased by a factor of 100. Such low resistance led to electric currents
  flowing across oceans, reaching previously unexplored lands like the Americas
  and Australia. These currents grew stronger, interconnecting almost all
  coastal regions worldwide. As a result, inland currents, which previously
  flourished, began to diminish.
</p>

<p>
  The matchlock, which Europeans had only recently adopted in 15th century, was
  sold by the Portuguese to Japan in 1543, just a century later, where it was
  massively replicated and named after the place of its introduction:
  "Tanegashima".
</p>

<p>
  Nagasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama became some of Japan's earliest industrialized
  cities due to their early trade with the West. In India, the port cities of
  Mumbai and Kolkata economically overshadowed Delhi, the former imperial
  capital. In China, Guangzhou and Shanghai symbolize modern maritime-driven
  globalization. In contrast, cities like Samarkand, Dunhuang, and Chang'an
  epitomized the grandeur of the Middle Ages when places like Guangzhou and
  Shanghai were of lesser significance.
</p>

<p>
  However, as the trade routes of the Eurasian steppes declined, people no
  longer viewed Central Asia as a source of precious goods or mysterious
  technologies. Their tales faded from popular memory, leaving behind enigmatic
  scrolls and caves.
</p>

<p><strong>Steamboats</strong></p>

<p>
  As we peer into the latter half of the maritime age, the steamboat emergents.
  The advent of the steamboat boosted ship speeds by more than double, making
  them less susceptible to the influences of wind direction and ocean currents.
  This reduced the resistance faced on the seas once more.
</p>

<p>
  However, it was the inland waterways that were truly revolutionized by
  steamboats. Before their invention, sailing against the current—battling
  gravity and water flow—required manual labor to tow, a highly challenging
  feat.
</p>

<p>
  Chongqing offers a particularly notable example. The middle and lower reaches
  of the Yangtze River had always been convenient for navigation. Yet, sailing
  against the current from Yichang, passing through the Three Gorges to reach
  the Sichuan Basin, was an arduous journey. The emergence of steamboats,
  however, normalized this mode of transport. Chongqing, almost overnight in the
  late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China period, exploded into
  prominence, becoming the "Hong Kong of Sichuan"—a transformation largely
  attributed to the steamboat.
</p>

<p>
  Initially, sailing vessels journeyed against the Hudson River's current from
  New York, heading inland only as far as Albany. But with the rise of
  steamboats, upstream travel became easier. Powered by this innovation,
  Americans carved out modern canals—the Erie Canal and the Chicago Canal. This
  connected New York to the entirety of the Great Lakes and the Midwest,
  providing a cost-effective transportation network.
</p>

<p>
  Consequently, docks, warehouses, and commodity stocks emerged along the
  Hudson, paving the way for futures trading, finance, insurance, and
  manufacturing sectors. While New York's history as a world capital can be
  linked to sailing vessels, it was decidedly shaped by steamboats.
</p>

<p>
  The East Coast, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi Basin, and the Ohio River
  region were interconnected, forming a vast circular zone of equal potential,
  sparking an immense flow of activity. Within this zone emerged many pillars of
  modern industry: Pittsburgh's steel, Detroit's cars, and Cleveland's
  petrochemicals, to name a few. Some businesses, within a short time, boosted
  their labor productivity by a factor of 100, even up to 10,000. These feats
  weren't just their own making. The environment—characterized by low resistance
  and strong flows—facilitated the abundant supply and transportation of goods.
  More importantly, there was efficient matching of technology and capital.
</p>

<p><strong>Railway</strong></p>

<p>
  The next world-changing, resistance-reducing mode of transport I'll discuss is
  the railway.
</p>

<p>
  In the days before railroads, the most important port on the Liaodong
  Peninsula was Yingkou. Sea shipping was the most cost-effective, so one would
  prefer ships to cover longer distances, minimizing expensive land travel.
</p>

<p>
  However, once railways were established, transport on land shifted to trains.
  For ships coming from overseas, it was inevitable to transfer goods to trains
  upon docking. Given this, it was more expedient to dock at the land's edge. As
  a result, the most significant port on the Liaodong Peninsula shifted to
  Dalian.
</p>

<p>
  Yantai, once more crucial than Qingdao, lost its significance after the Qing
  Dynasty when the railway between Qingdao and Jinan was completed. Qingdao soon
  eclipsed Yantai.
</p>

<p>
  In the USA, during the latter half of the 19th century, railways extended
  towards the western frontier. Before this, much of the vast North American
  West was largely excluded from the global economic map. In other words, it
  existed in a setting reminiscent of the Stone Age, marked by faint electric
  currents and high resistance. With the completion of the Transcontinental
  Railroad, this area was fully integrated into the global economic circuit.
</p>

<p>
  What's even more evident is the rise of California's economy. In 2018,
  California boasted a GDP of $3 trillion. If California were treated as a
  standalone country, its GDP would rank just below the top four – the US,
  China, Japan, and Germany; and surpassing the UK, France, and India, making it
  the fifth largest in the world. Washington State, where Seattle is located,
  has a GDP of $500 billion, roughly equivalent to that of Argentina.
</p>

<p>
  The Siberian Railway in Russia connected its European regions to the Far East.
  This development greatly amplified Russia's economic, political, and military
  presence on the Far Eastern coast. It also intensified tensions between Russia
  and Japan, leading to a power imbalance and culminating in the Russo-Japanese
  War.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, the Siberian Railway extended the USSR's influence over Central Asia
  and the Far East. During the subsequent Soviet-German War, the resources
  transported by this railway became vital for the Soviet Union's survival.
</p>

<p>
  Compared to camel caravans and wagons, railways reduced transportation costs
  by about 50 times. Beijing transitioned from a medieval land port, where
  camels lined up outside the city gates, to a central railway hub.
</p>

<p>
  Roads and railways further slashed inland transportation costs to more
  acceptable levels. This rejuvenated cities around the world, while cities
  situated along canals saw a decline in their status. Numerous canals worldwide
  were abandoned or transformed into tourist attractions, akin to what we
  observe along the Potomac River in places like London or Washington, D.C.
</p>

<p>
  Railways have been city creators. Harbin emerged from the intersection of the
  Siberian Railway's extensions in China – the East China Railway and the
  Harbin-Dalian Railway. Cities like Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou rose from
  intersections of the Beijing-Hankou Railway with the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan and
  Longhai railways respectively. Warren Buffett's hometown, Omaha, became a
  convergence point for railways in the eastern and western parts of the US.
  This is why these cities have developed into modern regional centers, and the
  origin of their cultural heritage.
</p>

<p><strong>Flatness and Disparity</strong></p>

<p>
  Following railways, major technological leaps in infrastructure emerged, such
  as the telegraph, telephone, and airplanes. The internet can be perceived as
  an enhancement in bandwidth of telephone and telegraph technologies.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, the speed and bandwidth of information transfer expanded infinitely,
  while costs plummeted to almost zero. The costs associated with the movement
  of goods decreased by thousands of times compared to the Stone Age. The entire
  planet moved closer to a state of technological equilibrium, where electric
  currents could virtually reach anywhere.
</p>

<p>
  Today, the inland region of Guizhou has become a hub for big data. Advanced
  research projects, like the FAST radio telescope, are situated there.
</p>

<p>
  Inland cities in the US like Nevada, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Phoenix have
  developed economically on par with coastal regions, even surpassing many areas
  worldwide. Transportation costs are no longer the primary or most sensitive
  expense.
</p>

<p>
  However, despite these advancements, the world we observe today remains full
  of disparities. As transportation costs reduced, other transaction costs
  became more noticeable.
</p>

<p>
  While new trends emerge, global business hubs are still primarily those cities
  that have long-standing commercial histories. The advantages they possess stem
  from their traditions – economic activities are path-dependent and continue
  along established trajectories. Traditional businesses and their practitioners
  have better reputations and stronger training capabilities, suggesting that
  traditional business networks likely hold cost advantages.
</p>

<p>
  Other disparities exist in the world, like environmental differences. Some
  individuals might leave Beijing due to its air quality, retiring or
  vacationing in the South, which is a milder difference. However, more
  pronounced is the climate disparity – New York's film industry gradually
  shifted to Los Angeles, given the year-round filming conditions. Populations
  in the northeastern and northern parts of the US continue to decrease, while
  those in the south and west increase, climate plays a role as higher equipment
  efficiency and lower heating expenses. In warm Hainan Island, we see most of
  the immigrants from cold Heilongjiang.
</p>

<p>
  Such disparities, capable of altering these traditional paths, give rise to
  new trends. However, the more potent disparities are those related to
  governance and politics.
</p>

<p>
  Gulf nations like Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE, when considering oil resources,
  geography, and population, don't differ significantly from other larger Middle
  Eastern nations. In ancient times, these smaller nations went unnoticed. Yet,
  the disparities in their political and judicial environments have led to their
  prosperity, in stark contrast to the difficulties of their neighbors.
</p>

<p>
  North and South Korea share similar traditions and peoples, yet their vast
  disparities in political environments have set them on divergent paths. While
  their contrasting internet policies offer a glimpse into these differences,
  they are emblematic of the broader and profound policy disparities that define
  each nation.
</p>
