<p>"<strong>Tones" of the Cities</strong></p>

<p>
  Every city possesses a unique tone that distinguishes it from others. Major
  global cities like London and New York, top-tier Chinese metropolises like
  Beijing and Shanghai, historical European hubs like London and Rome, and
  renowned Tuscan cities like Florence and Siena – each has a distinctive
  resonance.
</p>

<p>
  The term “tone” is an abstract and nebulous one. To facilitate comprehension,
  we can employ morphological observation methods and look at cities from
  various perspectives. In this installment, I will introduce the first
  perspective: cities as a sedimentation of time, embodying layers of diverse
  historical epochs. Each city is characterized by the richness of these layers,
  illustrating the varying speeds and levels of development they've undergone in
  different stages of their existence, which constitute essential morphological
  characteristics.
</p>

<p>
  Much like some plants have notably large roots (e.g., radishes and taros),
  others have prominent stems (like cacti), and yet others boast sizable fruits
  (such as watermelons), cities too have distinguishing features born from their
  unique evolution.
</p>

<p><strong>London Type - Chronological</strong></p>

<p>
  Consider London, with its remnants of ancient Roman walls and bridges – akin
  to the deep roots of a tree. The city’s medieval landmarks like the Tower of
  London and Westminster are like sturdy trunks supporting an organism that has
  sprouted abundant foliage from the architectural innovations of the 18th,
  19th, and subsequent centuries. Even today, areas like the City of London,
  King’s Cross, the South Bank, and Canary Wharf are vibrant with construction
  activities, akin to a tree continually sprouting new shoots. London embodies
  an elegant balance of historical layers, each contributing to the city's
  dynamic ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
  Munich, on the other hand, is akin to a smaller, yet equally balanced tree,
  bearing marks of WWII destruction more prominently than London. Although
  adorned with exquisite “flowers and fruits,” Munich lacks the iconic
  21st-century architectural masterpieces that London boasts.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >Rome Type - <strong><strong>Archaeological</strong></strong></strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Rome’s ancient ruins and grandeur in Baroque and medieval architecture liken
  the city to an exquisite, world-class root sculpture. It's a living, breathing
  entity, not preserved in formol but exposed to the elements and continuously
  functional. The newer constructions post the 19th century are modest, akin to
  saplings surrounding an ancient tree, honoring, not overshadowing, Rome’s
  historic grandeur.
</p>

<p>
  Florence, with a history spanning over two millennia, lacks the imperial
  posture of Rome but flaunts a robust medieval to Renaissance epoch, akin to
  Rome's morphological attributes. It enjoyed a brief yet transformative period
  as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, embedding a segment of 19th-century
  grandeur into its ancient texture. In contrast, Siena, Florence's medieval
  competitor, lacks this modern flourish, appearing like an aged yet preserved
  tree.
</p>

<p>
  Venice, living in the echoes of yesteryears and akin to Siena in the age of
  its architectural inventory, exudes an unusual vitality, fuelled by an
  exceedingly prosperous tourism industry, rendering it a lush yet anachronistic
  entity.
</p>

<p>
  These analogies aim to illustrate the analytical approach of understanding
  cities as living organisms, each with a distinct morphology shaped by their
  historical, cultural, and architectural evolution. Each city, akin to a unique
  plant species, has morphed and adapted through time, bearing the scars of
  history, the flourish of golden ages, and the continuous sprouting of modern
  innovations. This perspective enables a nuanced appreciation of the cities'
  unique tones, breathing life and narrative into the bricks and mortar of urban
  landscapes.
</p>

<p><strong>Beijing Type - Nursery around the Dying Root</strong></p>

<p>
  Beijing boasts temples and pagodas from the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, as
  well as the expansive old city from the Ming and Qing eras, epitomizing its
  deeply rooted history. Inside the ancient city, deteriorating residences and
  the hollowing of economic and social activities mirror the decay of an old
  tree's roots. Compared to major Western cities, and even Tianjin and Shanghai,
  Beijing has a paucity of modern architectural sediment. The city’s assets from
  the explosive growth period of the 1870s to 1940s, akin to Shanghai, are
  minimal, manifesting an underdeveloped trunk.
</p>

<p>
  However, the landscape changed in the 1970s with the emergence of social
  housing, sprouting branches of development. The 1990s heralded an era of
  unprecedented growth in international-style buildings and commercial housing.
  New districts, distinctly separated and not blended with the old, encircle the
  historical core. Thus, Beijing's appearance resembles a historic tree with
  flourishing secondary branches around its periphery, their grandeur and
  diversity echoing the majesty of the ancient roots.
</p>

<p>
  In contrast, most second and third-tier cities in northern China lack
  Beijing’s architectural symmetry. In their new districts, the view is
  dominated by buildings and streets from the past two decades, with even
  villages often razed. The landscape is characterized by uniformity, with
  standardized residential buildings occupying a significant proportion,
  supplemented mainly by international-style office buildings. This homogeneity,
  akin to beds of leeks and green onions in their uniformity and lack of
  historical layering, exemplifies the “thousand cities of one face” complaint.
  This phrase captures a widespread cityscape across China, where the ubiquity
  of similar urban forms engulfs a significant environmental share, marking a
  departure from the diverse historical and cultural expressions found in
  metropolises like Beijing.
</p>

<p><strong>North America Type - Young Trees</strong></p>

<p>
  The phenomenon criticized as “every city looks the same” is not exclusive to
  China. North American cities have faced similar critiques. Minneapolis, Fort
  Worth, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Edmonton, Montreal – over a hundred large and
  medium-sized cities in North America exhibit a striking uniformity. Each
  typically features a high-rise business district of a few square kilometers
  near a river, surrounded by industrial areas, and beyond that, an expanse of
  detached houses hidden amidst trees. Distinguishing between them can be
  challenging even for those who have visited them. The distinctive features of
  these cities are often not their architectures but their natural landscapes
  like mountains, rivers, and bays. Notable exceptions with distinct urban
  environments include Toronto, Miami, San Francisco, and Chicago.
</p>

<p>
  Most North American cities have similar historical sedimentary layers. Apart
  from a few, buildings over 200 years old are a rarity, and a significant
  number of cities have a developmental history of approximately 150 years.
  Their architectural spectrum spans Victorian, Edwardian, and modern
  international styles, a continuity over just over a century.
</p>

<p>
  Their economic cycles and developmental peaks are also strikingly similar. The
  oldest wave, the Gilded Age from 1860 to 1900, saw the emergence of sturdy,
  multi-storey red brick buildings and delicate brownstones, accompanied by
  ornate public buildings. These enduring structures still constitute 30-40% of
  many urban areas. Post-1900 brought the rise of elevator-equipped high-rise
  steel structures, now making up around 20% of the building stock in major US
  cities. The 1950s marked the beginning of suburbanization, with detached
  houses and suburban industrial parks dominating over 90% of the area beyond
  city centers. Urban renewal in the 1960s introduced low-standard social
  housing, followed by some revitalization of downtown areas from the 1980s,
  characterized by glass curtain wall skyscrapers – a trend persisting to the
  present.
</p>

<p>
  This typifies the historical stratification of North American cities. The
  architectural similarity across the continent is undeniable. Despite the
  individuality of each building, the overall similarity is overwhelming.
</p>

<p>This is the North American version of "every city looks the same."</p>

<p>
  However, it’s not as extreme as the uniformity found in new Chinese cities.
  It’s more akin to a nursery of young saplings rather than a field of identical
  scallions. Despite the monotony, there’s a semblance of complex order within,
  and these cities seem healthier and more resilient to environmental
  fluctuations.
</p>

<p>
  In the apparent monotony of North American "sapling cities," there are
  <strong>internal variations</strong>. Atlanta, for example, has a scarcity of
  brownstone assets, a consequence of the severe damage it sustained during the
  Civil War and the limited, lower-quality architectural resources available
  during the post-war recovery. In the nursery of North America, it’s like a
  tree with charred roots, boasting vigorous secondary branches.
</p>

<p>
  Cincinnati's zenith was around the Gilded Age. The city center's development
  has been limited since, with parts of the urban area frozen in the state of a
  century ago, evoking a sleeping, bygone world. Even in the city center,
  post-1980s developments are scarce, and many of the finest structures still
  hail from a hundred years ago.
</p>

<p>
  Detroit's golden age was later and loftier, spanning from 1900 to 1970. It was
  a major industrial and inland shipping center in the U.S., the primary phase
  for the accumulation of its architectural wealth. Even today, it’s surrounded
  by a metropolitan area of over 4 million people. However, the decline of its
  city center is stark. Despite considerable revitalization efforts, the
  downturn seems irreversible. We observe the decay of an advanced tree adorned
  with exotic blooms, surrounded by an extensive secondary forest.
</p>

<p><strong>Tokyo Type - Secondary Forest with Biodiversity</strong></p>

<p>
  Japanese cities, while boasting historical richness in places like Kyoto,
  Kanazawa, and Kamakura as exceptions, generally exude a sensation of secondary
  forests, even more so than their American counterparts. The prevalence of this
  feeling can be attributed to the scarcity of architectural assets from the
  pre-industrial era in Japan, most of which were wooden constructions and have
  scarcely survived to the present day. Moreover, the devastation wrought upon
  traditional urban areas during the war was significant.
</p>

<p>
  In the post-war era, Japanese cities experienced a confluence of rapid
  urbanization and reconstruction, technological advancement, and economic
  explosion. These factors led to a substantial accumulation of small buildings
  initiated in the 1950s and 1960s in major Japanese cities. Concentrated in age
  yet limited in quality, these structures resemble the "urban villages"
  familiar to the Chinese populace. Japan's urban villages have been undergoing
  constant integration and gentrification, resulting in a Tokyo where most
  houses are meticulously refined, albeit small in scale. This gradual, balanced
  approach between efficiency and decorum hints at a secondary forest evolving
  into a complex, diversified order.
</p>

<p>
  To some extent, this reflects a relatively healthy developmental trajectory
  for cities in the developing world, with Japan slightly (maybe 60 years) ahead
  of the curve.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>A Manifesto</strong>
  <strong>to Its Socio-Political Climate in History </strong>
</p>

<p>
  From the examples outlined, the conceptual approach to observing historical
  stratification should be clearer. People are often drawn to cities enriched
  with historical sedimentation, layered history, and traditional spaces, as
  they emit signals of distinct character.
</p>

<p>
  A city with a history spanning thousands of years and continuous habitation
  signifies geological and hydrological stability—an assuring testament to its
  excellent geological/geographical location.
</p>

<p>
  The survival of exquisite architecture spanning centuries indicates a
  relatively continuous, stable society that hasn’t suffered massive
  humanitarian catastrophes leading to the destruction of civilization. These
  delicate structures, vulnerable as they are, signify surplus generation or a
  bustling trade location, evidencing the nurturing and preservation of cultural
  traditions.
</p>

<p>
  Conversely, the absence of historical structures signals dynastic changes and
  societal turbulence. In this light, the intact architectures become not just
  symbols of aesthetic or historical value, but indicators of societal
  stability, prosperity, and continuity. These structures and their associated
  urban environments serve as silent testimonials to the multifaceted narratives
  of their cities, weaving intricate tapestries of history, culture, and
  evolution that transcend the immediacy of contemporary urban landscapes.
</p>
