<h1>33 the Language of Urban Design (2) Radial, Grand Manner</h1>

<p>
  In this chapter, I continue with the discussion on the language of urban
  design.
</p>

<p>
  Following the grid pattern, let's delve into another urban design lexicon:
  radial roads.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps the most iconic representation of radial roads is the roundabout
  centered on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, from which 12 straight streets
  radiate. Another famous example is from Rome, where from the Piazza del Popolo
  at the northern end of the ancient city, roads radiate southward in a trident
  shape. Worth noting are Zhongshan Square in Dalian and Zhongshan Square in
  Shenyang, which share similar designs.
</p>

<p>
  While grid patterns can be found almost everywhere, the design of radial roads
  isn't present in every city. It is quite an extraordinary design. Radial roads
  give a distinct sense of centrality. Often, this center is candidly
  highlighted by memorial structures like the Arc de Triomphe, grand statues of
  eminent personalities, or obelisks. This radial design often leaves a lasting
  impression on observers. Its tone is very artificial, deliberate, and
  ceremonious, evoking a sense of imperial grandeur.
</p>

<p>
  However, if we observe from a broader scale on a map, and zoom out to a
  certain extent, you'll notice that large cities like Beijing exhibit this
  radial pattern in their highway network. Numerous highways radiate outward,
  connecting to satellite towns and further distant cities. Even if the inner
  city uses a grid pattern, once you leave the traditional urban areas, roads
  break free from the grid constraints and head directly towards their
  destinations.

  <p>(<em>figure above: city grid and modern radial highways; </em></p>

  <p><em>figure below: streets radiate from the city gate</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>
  Every city operates this way, maintaining direct routes to their primary
  surrounding destinations. Numerous cities, regardless of their size, each
  serve as the center of a radial road system, together forming a spider
  web-like transportation network. Naturally occurring radial road patterns
  often appear outside city gates. For example, outside many gates of Lucca,
  you'll see roads leading to the front-left, front-center, and front-right. In
  Beijing's Qianmen area to the south, many diagonal streets form a radial
  pattern.
</p>

<p><strong>Direct Connections</strong></p>

<p>
  Within a grid pattern, wherever you go, you're bound to make one or multiple
  right-angle turns; there are no diagonal shortcuts. In contrast, a radial road
  pattern is essentially a combination of direct routes to the center. As the
  saying goes, "All roads lead to Rome." Therefore, the design language of
  radial road networks largely draws inspiration from the inherent order where
  all places converge towards the center. Evidently, this trend is rooted in
  efficiency.
</p>

<p>Radial road networks also produce other practical effects.</p>

<p><strong>Vista and Hunting Gardens</strong></p>

<p>
  Firstly, landmarks at the center facilitate navigation within the city. The 12
  straight roads radiating from the roundabout of the Arc de Triomphe imply that
  from each of these roads, one can view the Arc. This greatly aids in
  orientation. This radial design can also be seen in European gardens, where
  several or perhaps dozens of straight paths converge onto a circular clearing.
  Often, a pavilion or another marker is placed there.
</p>

    /></a>

<p>
  When hunters traverse the dark woods, it's easy to lose their sense of
  direction. However, as they cross these paths, they can spot distant markers,
  providing a sense of direction. This spatial sensation, where one can see a
  landmark at the end of a straight road from afar, is often utilized in urban
  design. This concept is termed "Vista."
</p>

<p>
  Secondly, from such central convergence points, one can oversee all the radial
  paths. In hunting gardens, deer move randomly amongst the trees. When a leader
  chases prey, they shouldn’t wander aimlessly. Instead, spotters positioned at
  these junctions can identify which sector the deer entered. Having multiple
  observation points in the woods makes it easier to locate prey and guide the
  leader towards the deer.
</p>

<p>
  In cities, radial structures are rare, with prisons being the main example.
</p>

  /></a>
</figure>

<p><strong>Prison Plan</strong></p>

<p>
  Prison cellblocks often comprise several straight corridors converging at a
  point where a guard sits, able to monitor all the hallways simultaneously.
  This greatly economizes on manpower.
</p>

<p>
  Paris, before the 19th century, was a city often marred by revolution. The
  Paris we see today underwent transformation during Napoleon's reign,
  resembling a hunting garden or prison in its layout. Its well-developed radial
  boulevards are conducive for barricading individual blocks, making it easier
  to isolate and encircle any uprising masses.
</p>

<p><strong>Palladian Vista</strong></p>

<p>
  The functions described might be practical sources for the development of
  radial road networks. However, inspirations might also be drawn from stage set
  designs, like Palladio's work at the Olympic Theatre in Vicenza. Here,
  Palladio constructed a three-dimensional virtual city as a backdrop. The stage
  is positioned as if at the convergence of five streets, allowing audiences to
  view the mid and distant sceneries of the city. The concept of Vista is
  extensively explored on this stage. Stagecraft and other artistic works, in
  the past, played roles similar to today’s photographs, comics, films, and
  television, and they've had influence on urban or architectural design.

<p><strong>The Grand Manner, Rome, Versaille, Washington</strong></p>

<p>
  The urban design language of the radial road network is also referred to by an
  art historical term: "grand manner". The history of its formation as a design
  language isn't as ancient as we might imagine; it's primarily a modern
  phenomenon. It possibly began in 16th century Rome during the reign of Pope
  Sixtus V. He sought to reorganize the city quarters to restore governance and
  reaffirm the Church's authority. The renovation aimed to connect pilgrimage
  sites through direct avenues, intending Rome to be an imperial city. However,
  candidly speaking, the avenues initiated by the Church were merely over ten
  meters wide. In comparison, the endeavors of Mussolini, who expanded the road
  in front of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome to 30 meters, or Ceaușescu, who
  widened the boulevard in front of the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest to
  90 meters, were far more aggressive, with each subsequent ruler exhibiting an
  exponential increase in autocracy.
</p>

<p>
  After 16th century Rome, the grand manner approach didn't flourish
  immediately. It took another century until the late 17th century, during the
  era of Louis XIV and the Palace of Versailles, for it to gain clearer
  expression. Versailles symbolized the absolutism in France. French lords, akin
  to Japanese lords during the Edo period or the feudal families in post-Qin
  China, were centralized around the monarch, weakening their ties to their
  subjects and territories. Versailles served as a tool to diminish the feudal
  rights of these lords. From a development perspective, since Versailles was in
  the suburbs and required limited redevelopment, the overall cost was not
  particularly high.
</p>

<p>
  Surprisingly, the next imperial city to employ the grand manner was in 1791
  America. The French surveyor L'Enfant designed Washington, D.C., with a richly
  layered, well-ordered and radial road network. The radial avenues emanated
  primarily from the U.S. Capitol and the White House. These avenues were named
  after U.S. states: Pennsylvania Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Connecticut
  Avenue, and so on. These streets lead in all directions, symbolically
  connecting to various parts of the vast American states. Washington, D.C. can
  be described as a city filled with grandeur, symbolic meaning, and monuments
  that ooze patriotism.
</p>

<p>
  It's hard to overlook the stark contrast between the urban temperament of
  Washington, D.C., and New York City. New York stands as the practical, compact
  capital of the capitalist world, entirely dissimilar from Washington.
  Moreover, both cities frequently appear in films and TV, etching contrasting
  impressions of America in the minds of viewers. Which one truly represents
  American culture?
</p>

<p>
  New York symbolizes the amalgamation of immigrants from around the world,
  minority groups, subcultures, and intellectuals, providing the United States
  with economic vigor and innovative prowess. In contrast, Washington, D.C.,
  stands as an affirmation of America's loyal warriors and patriots. It serves
  as a sacred site where the American spirit is revered almost religiously,
  advocating American exceptionalism and a martial ethos. These two cities
  epitomize the duality of America, and the nation couldn't thrive solely on one
  aspect.
</p>

<p>
  The grand design of Washington, D.C., isn't necessarily linked to autocracy.
  After all, in 1791, the designated area for the capital was practically a
  blank slate, with a population smaller than nearby villages. There wasn't
  significant concern about how its streets should be laid out. The original
  landowners willingly donated the lands needed for the roads to the federal
  government, subsequently profiting from the appreciation in value of their
  remaining parcels. For its initial 100 years, the capital area consisted of
  only a few residences of officials near the White House and Capitol, as well
  as a handful of newspaper offices. Most didn't pay much attention to it, nor
  were they certain it would develop according to L'Enfant's original design.
  Today, it's hard to imagine that where the vast lawn in front of the Capitol
  stands, there were once railway tracks, and where the National Gallery of Art
  is located today, there used to be a train station where people boarded trains
  to Baltimore.
</p>

<p>
  It wasn't until 1902, with Congress's approval of the McMillan Plan, that the
  city's monumental nature, as envisioned in the original design, was not only
  preserved but also amplified. The Washington, D.C., we recognize today, as the
  ultimate embodiment of the "Grand Manner", emerged after another century had
  passed.
</p>

<p>
  During the interval we've discussed,
  <strong>Paris under Napoleon III</strong> underwent a Grand Manner
  redevelopment in the mid-to-late 19th century.
</p>

<p>
  From the perspective of emphasizing monumentality and nation-building, both
  Paris and Washington, D.C. stand out significantly. If not deemed outright
  successes, they are at least notable achievements that demand attention.
</p>

<p>
  If you argue that Paris succeeded, consider this: France, under the reigns of
  Louis XIV and Napoleon, was powerful enough to challenge the entirety of
  Europe. Yet, after the heroic/romantic immersion of Paris's grand projects,
  France found itself defeated by Prussia, previously a secondary power in
  Europe.
</p>

<p><strong>Some Technical Discussions on the Grand Manner</strong></p>

<p>
  Setting aside the aspect of monumentality and returning to the functional
  perspective of radiating road networks, a proper configuration can create
  <strong>shortcuts </strong>between urban destinations, potentially improving
  traffic efficiency. In the case of Paris, the grand boulevards functioned as
  the primary arteries of traffic, while the medieval street grid of Paris was
  largely relegated to serving as alleys or secondary roads, leading to a
  relatively clear traffic system.
</p>

<p>
  In contrast, Washington, D.C.'s design <strong>superimposed </strong>radial
  roads onto a grid system similar to Chicago's. Each system would work
  efficiently on its own, but when combined with comparable widths, it becomes
  challenging to differentiate the primary from the secondary. Ideally, the
  radial boulevards would serve as main roads while the grid would act as
  secondary or tertiary routes. However, the radial boulevards in D.C. are often
  interrupted by roundabouts and parks, making the continuous grid more
  dominant. Furthermore, the streets of the grid system are quite wide,
  averaging about 27 meters. Such streets, especially in commercial areas,
  inevitably carry substantial traffic volumes. For instance, M Street and L
  Street in Northwest D.C. might seem like secondary roads on a map, but they
  experience higher traffic than nearby Vermont Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue.
  This results in an <strong>inversion </strong>of the intended
  <strong>hierarchy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  This design has led to incredibly complex intersections and a plethora of
  one-way streets. Though the system might appear clear at first glance,
  numerous "patches" have been added over time to address practical issues,
  compromising its intuitiveness and introducing various traffic pitfalls. For
  drivers, especially those unfamiliar with the city, navigating Washington,
  D.C. can pose a significant challenge, showcasing the inherent problems with
  its road system.
</p>

<p><strong>Pattern of the Grand Manner's Diffusion</strong></p>

<p>
  Returning to the historical narrative, in both Europe and the Americas, the
  late 19th century saw rapid urban development due to the Industrial
  Revolution, a situation akin to China around the turn of the 2000s. With
  world-class capitals like Paris and Washington, D.C. as exemplary models,
  various cities during their expansion phases eagerly adopted the Grand Manner
  style. Barcelona, Marseille, Milan, Florence, and many other rapidly
  developing cities during this period, to varying degrees, incorporated
  elements of this approach, leaving clear historical imprints. However, the
  complexity of most European cities' environments meant there was limited space
  for grand-scale planning, resulting in a more restrained application of the
  Grand Manner style.
</p>

<p>From this, <strong>several patterns</strong> can be discerned:</p>

<p>
  Firstly, as mentioned earlier, new cities more easily embraced the Grand
  Manner style, while older ones found it challenging.
</p>

<p>
  Secondly, areas that didn't experience much economic growth in the 19th
  century, such as Venice and Siena, missed out on this trend and didn't witness
  the emergence of the Grand Manner.
</p>

<p>
  Thirdly, the prominence of this style was influenced by cultural and political
  environments. Throughout the 19th century, the UK, which was leading the
  global order, had only subtle expressions of this architectural language. In
  contrast, "second-tier" powers that were challengers, like France, Italy, and
  Spain, displayed it more conspicuously. In countries like the Netherlands,
  Germany, and Switzerland, it was less evident.
</p>

<p>
  One could interpret these patterns from various angles. At a glance, regions
  where the Grand Manner was popular were predominantly Latin-speaking, while it
  seemed less favored in Germanic-speaking regions. It appeared more embraced in
  Catholic areas and less so in Protestant regions. A cursory observation might
  also suggest that areas with especially rapid economic growth in the late 19th
  century didn't favor it as much, while those with moderate growth did. The
  spread of architectural styles might be linked with language, cultural
  circles, and levels of economic development. However, some patterns don't
  entirely fit this mold.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Economical and Political Foundations for the Grand Manner</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Logically, faster economic growth should provide more funds for large-scale
  urban construction. For instance, France's economy grew rapidly in the late
  19th century. Napoleon III's grand redevelopment of Paris, a top-tier
  international city, was among the most audacious of its kind. I believe a key
  reason for its success was that mid-19th-century Paris was in a prolonged
  period of peace, marked by economic growth and soaring real estate values -
  somewhat resembling modern-day China. There was a golden window when property
  prices were rising annually. If the government decided to demolish and rebuild
  an area, offering to compensate homeowners with half of the newly constructed
  space (which was three times larger), everyone benefitted. Within three years,
  property values might double, increasing a homeowner's assets threefold,
  without the government incurring losses. However, it remains debatable whether
  the increase in property value was directly linked to the government's
  redevelopment. During such times, profits are easily generated, and these
  profits could offset the costs incurred by massive demolitions and
  constructions.
</p>

<p>
  I hypothesize that rulers generally have an inclination towards the Grand
  Manner. However, in areas with well-preserved feudal traditions and freedoms,
  such as in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, the Grand Manner
  doesn't find much room to manifest. In contrast, in regions where feudal
  liberties are weaker or where the balance between rulers and the ruled is more
  unequal—including colonies like North America—the Grand Manner finds its
  expression, given there's sufficient economic surplus. I believe this provides
  a more reliable historical explanation.
</p>

<p><strong>The Spread to the Other Worlds</strong></p>

<p>
  Consider the 20th century. Western civilization continued its global spread.
  The radiating road networks and grand-scale planning, which couldn't fully
  manifest in the heartlands of Western civilization, shone brightly in its
  peripheries: New Delhi in India and Canberra in Australia became new bastions
  of the Grand Manner. Hence, I argue that the lack of popularity of the Grand
  Manner in mainland UK wasn't due to the British disliking it, nor was it
  strictly related to language or religion. It was simply harder to implement at
  home. In their colonies, where there were fewer restrictions, the British
  pursued it with gusto.
</p>

<p>
  These two cases, unsurprisingly, can be categorized under my list of
  experimental, resource-draining projects. Unlike the self-sustaining
  redevelopment of Paris, the developments in New Delhi and Canberra were purely
  financially draining. Beyond their grand scale and radiating patterns, they
  also adopted an anti-urban utopian style characteristic of early automobile
  suburbs. Even in their respective countries, these projects didn't necessarily
  garner high praise.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps, when economic constraints are minimal, there's a risk of frivolity,
  leading to less thoughtful urban planning.
</p>

<p>
  In the 20th century, Japan, as an ardent admirer of Western civilization,
  continued to embrace urban designs that the West was starting to outgrow.
  Frankly, the Grand Manner wasn't easily applicable in mainland Japan, given
  its careful resource allocation. However, during Japan's imperial ventures in
  Northeast China, Japanese architects, influenced by Western culture, fervently
  implemented grand urban designs in cities like Shenyang, Anshan, and
  Changchun, leaving a legacy of roundabouts and radiating avenues.
</p>

<p>
  In the core area of civilization, ideas and technologies coexist in a diverse,
  mixed, and relatively balanced state. Yet, the more radical, non-mainstream,
  idealistic, and experimental concepts, which might not dominate in the center,
  often find their most extreme expression on the peripheries.
</p>

<p>
  It's akin to how urban planning in modern China is currently influenced by the
  modernist ideals invented by the Western architects a century ago. This
  mirrors what Confucius said about traditions being sought in the wilderness
  when they fade in the center. The most traditional elements might get
  overshadowed in the heart of civilization but linger on its edges. These are
  two patterns of dissemination—structurally similar but directionally opposite.
</p>
