<h1>
  12 the Evolution of Trade Routes Affected by the Competition between
  Governments
</h1>

<p>
  In the previous two chapters, I discussed various factors by which geography
  fosters the growth of cities. For instance, cities situated at mountain pass
  crossroads, at the nexus of water and land transport, or on riverbanks
  suitable for bridge construction or fording, among others.
</p>

<p>
  However, while these geographical advantages make these sites particularly apt
  for the emergence of commercial hubs, it doesn't mean they automatically
  become global trading centers. Their success isn't solely attributable to
  geography. Put simply, even with prime geographical conditions, if the ruling
  class is self-centered and narrow-minded, and the merchant community is feeble
  and cannot self-govern, such geographical advantages can be wasted.
</p>

<p><strong>Paris and Troyes</strong></p>

<p>
  From a narrow perspective, Paris occupies a unique geographical position. Yet,
  when viewed on a broader scale, within a few hundred kilometers, it indeed has
  competitors.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to modern times, a notable competitor was the Champagne region, located
  over 100 kilometers east of Paris.
</p>

<p>
  Nowadays, when we mention Champagne, we typically refer to the renowned wine.
  But in the Middle Ages, Champagne was more illustrious as a count's territory
  and the commercial epicenter of Northwestern Europe.
</p>

<p>
  Its geographical positioning, especially its core city, Troyes, posed a
  significant commercial challenge to Paris. Like Paris, Troyes was situated on
  an ancient Roman route and served as a nexus between the Rhone and Seine river
  valleys. Goods from Italy, Spain, North Africa, and even further east – such
  as pepper, precious metals, silk, and notably dyes – traveled up the Rhone.
  Alternatively, they crossed the Alps to the west of Turin, passing the Senis
  Mountain Pass at an altitude of 2080 meters, and then headed north by land.
  These goods converged with furs and textiles from Flanders, a region that is
  part of modern-day Belgium and was the European textile industry's heartland
  back then. The amalgamation of dyes and fabrics, and the immense value this
  union created, was the cornerstone of this trade.
</p>

<p>
  During the 12th and 13th centuries, the Champagne fairs in this region
  flourished, a testament to the competitive trade policies championed by the
  Count of Champagne.
</p>

<p>
  In many narratives, the Middle Ages are portrayed as insular, dark, and
  regressive. Such a view is, in many respects, an inheritance from the
  revolutionary ideologies.
</p>

<p>
  The reality of the Middle Ages was decidedly more nuanced. It was an era of
  collapsing authoritarianism. Regional rulers often welcomed merchants to
  bolster their territories' competitiveness. Trade not only generated tax
  revenue but merchants also brought strategic resources and military technology
  – all highly coveted by the militaristic rulers. Hence, policy competition was
  essential to attract investments and traders.
</p>

<p>
  The Count of Champagne was exemplary in this policy-driven approach. He
  ensured the safety and property rights of merchants within his territory. He
  entered into trade agreements with other lords to guarantee the free passage
  and property security for traveling merchants.
</p>

<p>
  The County of Champagne offered judicial services for commercial disputes,
  allowing for cost-effective resolutions. Naturally, in the process, the
  Champagne authorities reaped significant tax benefits.
</p>

<p>
  The storage and financial services supporting the Champagne markets became
  increasingly sophisticated. Italian merchants from afar often didn't need to
  carry physical currency or even visit the market personally. Transactions
  could be completed via messengers using financial credits – akin to a medieval
  version of payPal.
</p>

<p>
  Paris and Champagne, once rivals for trade routes, saw their competition
  conclude when the fate of their respective protectors was sealed. In the 10th
  century, the Capet family, counts of Paris, ascended to the French throne. By
  1314, Louis X, the twelfth-generation king from the Capet lineage, inherited
  the County of Champagne from his mother, resulting in the French royalty
  annexing Champagne. With its political architects gone, Champagne's prominence
  as a trade center dwindled. From then on, Paris eclipsed Champagne, firmly
  establishing itself as the heart of the French region.
</p>

<p>
  The story doesn’t end there. It's not as though Paris simply stepped into
  Champagne's shoes. The King of France, as the ruler of a vast nation, didn't
  rely on commerce the way the Count of Champagne did. Quite the opposite, in
  fact. Autocratic rulers of large nations often perceived the rise of bourgeois
  merchants in commercial cities as threats to their dominance. As a result,
  merchants in Paris found themselves in a subordinate position within this
  nation, meaning Paris couldn't quite match the glory of Champagne in its
  prime.
</p>

<p><strong>Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp</strong></p>

<p>
  The decline of Champagne created a void in the commercial system, and it was
  to be filled by competitors operating on a broader scale. This new player was
  Bruges in Flanders.
</p>

<p>
  If the main trade parties were goods from Italy and Flanders, it made sense
  for the Mediterranean trade representatives - the Genoese merchants - to skip
  France altogether and sail directly to Bruges in the North Sea. Thus, Bruges,
  along with Ghent, Ypres, Antwerp, and a few other Flemish cities, emerged as
  Europe's new trade hub, succeeding Champagne.
</p>

<p><strong>Amsterdam and London</strong></p>

<p>
  The saga continues. In the 16th century, the Low Countries were caught in the
  throes of both religious and ethnic turmoil. During the Dutch War of
  Independence, Flanders - present-day Belgium - fell under the control of the
  Habsburg dynasty. The ensuing warfare led to significant population
  displacement and tightened political controls.
</p>

<p>
  Antwerp lost its esteemed position as a trade nexus. Meanwhile, in the north,
  Amsterdam and Rotterdam, part of the newly independent Dutch Republic,
  outshone their Flemish counterparts. These cities witnessed the birth of
  modern capitalism and were at the heart of the Dutch maritime dominance in the
  17th century, often referred to as the 'Golden Age' of the Netherlands.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, the grasp of absolute monarchs was to stretch even further. By 1672,
  France had become Europe's preeminent absolute monarchy and had expanded its
  borders, looming ominously over its Dutch neighbor. In the war of that year,
  Louis XIV nearly flattened the Netherlands. Meanwhile, England underwent the
  Glorious Revolution, decisively becoming a parliamentary-driven capitalist
  nation. Consequently, Northern Europe's center of commerce shifted from
  Amsterdam to London, across the Channel.
</p>

<p><strong>Merchant States</strong></p>

<p>
  In the series of events detailed above, we observe that a global trade hub
  must be a place where merchants are at the core of its societal governance,
  where they have autonomy, and there's a high degree of commercial freedom.
</p>

<p>
  Absolute monarchs may indeed control major commercial cities and have the
  chance to expand their rule. However, the consequence of such control is the
  city losing its status as a trade hub. This pivotal role is then taken over by
  neighboring regions with a more business-friendly environment.
</p>

<p><strong>Euroasian Trade Rountes</strong></p>

<p>
  The West Asian region has always functioned as a hub in the trade networks in
  Euroasian continent. In terms of the actual trade routes, there's a northern
  path traversing the Black Sea leading to the Inner Asian Steppes; the central
  route goes through the historically significant Fertile Crescent, connecting
  to the Persian Gulf and regions in Iran; and the southern route takes one
  through Egypt and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean.
</p>

<p>
  Related to these three trade routes, various trade cities prospered. This
  includes Mediterranean trade city-states like Venice, Pisa, and Genoa; Black
  Sea's Constantinople and Trabzon; Levant's Aleppo; Alexandria in Egypt; and
  Aden along the Red Sea, to name a few.
</p>

<p>
  During the medieval times, these routes were under the dominion of various
  lords from the Byzantine Empire, Umayyad Caliphate, and Abbasid Caliphate.
  None of these powers could monopolize the East-West trade. However, by the
  15th century, the Ottoman Empire seized control of all three passages. This
  allowed them to enjoy the lion's share of the benefits from the East-West
  trade by leveraging monopoly rents.
</p>

<p>
  This led to diminishing profits for European merchants in the Mediterranean
  region.
</p>

<p>
  However, this scenario didn't last for long. Soon after, Portuguese sailors
  discovered a trade route circumventing the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of
  Good Hope. This sparked a shift in the trade epicenter. While the old trade
  hubs experienced an irreversible decline, new trade points began to emerge
  along the Atlantic coast, African shores, and in the Indian Ocean.
</p>

<p>
  This shift is reflected in modern pop culture too; for instance, the family of
  the protagonist in the recent movie "Bohemian Rhapsody" hails from the East
  African trade city of Zanzibar. Other noteworthy trade points include Goa on
  the Indian coast and Malacca
</p>

<p><strong>West Pacific Trade Routes</strong></p>

<p>
  Similarly, in the Yuan Dynasty, the largest trade center along the coast of
  East Asia was Quanzhou (or Zayton). The Ming Dynasty wiped out the
  international trader community in Quanzhou, and imposed a sea ban to prohibit
  private maritime trade. In this way, the trade transit point was transferred
  to Ryukyu on the sea. Before that, Ryukyu, an archipelago with some indigenous
  inhabitants, was commercially insignificant. From then on, it suddenly became
  a big port. The modern Ryukyu Kingdom was born at this point in time. After
  the Opium War, international trade points began to be established on the coast
  of the East Asian continent, and Japan also opened up maritime trade, and
  Ryukyu became no longer important.
</p>

<p><strong>Malacca and Singapore</strong></p>

<p>
  Malacca, long before Zheng He's voyages, was a major hub of strait trade. This
  status persisted through the period of the Malacca Muslim Sultanate, the
  Portuguese colonization, and into the era of the Dutch East India Company.
  However, while each commercial colonial group occupied the port of Malacca,
  clashes were common with neighboring sultanates, which even led to diplomatic
  conflicts with Java, Annam, and even the Ming dynasty.
</p>

<p>
  The shift began with the British Governor Stamford Raffles. In 1819, Raffles
  discovered the island of Singapore. Initially appealing due to its sparse
  population, thus offering a significant development potential. Separated from
  the mainland by a strait, it was easier for the powerful British navy to
  isolate, making it less susceptible to the surrounding conflicts. This seemed
  to better fit the British model for a trade port. The British leased the
  island of Singapore from the Sultan of Johor and began its development.
</p>

<p>
  Subsequently, Singapore gradually overtook Malacca as the central hub of
  strait trade. Today, everyone knows of Singapore, but few remember Malacca.
</p>

<p><strong>Shanghai and Hongkong</strong></p>

<p>
  In 1920, the most significant trade metropolis in East Asia was undoubtedly
  Shanghai, with Hong Kong trailing behind. However, by the 1950s, commercial
  cities like Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing were "liberated" by the communists
  and detached from the global trade system. This resulted in a large portion of
  East Asian trade shifting to Hong Kong.
</p>

<p>
  In 1945, post-war Hong Kong had a population of only 600,000. By 1951, it
  surged to 2 million, 3 million by 1960, 4 million by 1972, and 5 million by
  1980. Every 20 years, the population doubled.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, as mainland China initiated its economic reforms and opening-up policies,
  rejoining the global trade system, Hong Kong's population growth rate started
  to decline. From 5 million in 1980, it increased to 7.5 million over the next
  40 years, a growth of only 50%. In contrast, Shanghai's population growth rate
  overtook Hong Kong's in the 1990s. From 10 million in 1980, Shanghai's
  population soared to its current 26 million, more than doubling. Financially
  speaking, Shanghai's GDP, at 490 billion USD, also surpassed Hong Kong's 360
  million USD. Even the emerging city of Shenzhen's GDP now exceeds that of Hong
  Kong.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, Hong Kong's per capita output still significantly outpaces these
  mainland regions. But it has receded to become merely one node in the
  commercial network, rather than the singular, dominant node it once was.
</p>

<p><strong>Government and Trade</strong></p>

<p>
  Upon examining these cases, one can discern the profound impact of policies on
  the progression of trade routes. This phenomenon might aptly be described as
  "policy competition." Not all policies emerge from deliberate planning; some
  may arise from either intentional or unintentional decisions. Intriguingly,
  those in competition may remain oblivious to their rivalry. They might be
  indifferent to urban growth, especially if it doesn't coincide with their
  objectives. Policy influencers, while potentially curbing commercial
  liberties, could stand to gain, albeit momentarily, from their interventions.
</p>

<p>
  This overarching "competition" is extensive, encompassing the actions and
  strategies adopted by myriad individuals and entities. Effective governance
  acts as a catalyst for commercial growth. Yet, the structured order introduced
  by dominant centralized forces typically challenges commercial autonomy. The
  intent behind such opposition is to undermine self-governing commercial
  entities. These self-regulated commercial groups are affluent and at the
  forefront of technological innovation. Their ascent heralds the looming
  decline of autocratic governance. Such influential commercial entities can
  confront and even overturn authoritarian regimes, altering political terrains
  and structures. Historical precedents include medieval Venice, and more
  recently, Florence, the Netherlands, and England.
</p>

<p>
  These autonomous commercial factions constitute the backbone of their
  respective nations, rendering monarchs and military forces as their
  instruments. The policies of these nations lean away from rigid ideologies,
  prioritizing market dynamics and effectiveness. This ethos has equally
  advantaged the U.S. and other territories influenced by British traditions.
  They bask in the lucrative returns of commerce and international trade.
</p>

<p><strong>Recap to Previous Chapters</strong></p>

<p>
  The same conclusions can be extended to almost all cities. Take Berlin, for
  instance, which serves as a nexus between the trade networks of the Elbe and
  Oder river systems. Warsaw stands as the hub of the Vistula river basin.
  Vienna occupies a strategic chokepoint on the Danube River, lying between the
  Alps and the Carpathians.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, the growth of a city is intimately linked with the evolution of
  regional trade routes. Routes that optimize energy consumption often persist
  through evolution:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Trade routes typically extend between resource points. They are influenced
    by terrain, generally following valleys or passages between mountain peaks.
    Routes tend to stretch along directions with minimal elevation changes to
    conserve the energy of both humans and livestock.
  </li>

  <li>
    Boats possess a far greater cargo capacity than human or animal carriages,
    making waterways crucial transport channels. Interconnected water systems
    foster commercial networks, promoting convenient exchanges and often
    creating zones with similar technological and cultural advancements.
    Meanwhile, between unconnected water systems, there might be technological
    and cultural disparities, generating a strong incentive for exchange. The
    most accessible land connections between river basins often evolve into key
    trade routes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Ferry crossings and bridges give rise to commercial cities. Within such
    cities, it's common to observe islets in the middle of rivers, typical
    geographic landmarks for ferry points and bridge constructions.
  </li>

  <li>
    Trade routes, with their intricate twists and turns, are the outcome of
    various complex factors, combined in a weighted function.
  </li>

  <li>
    These routes are not necessarily rational; they are the results of
    evolutionary selection. Inefficient trade routes sap the energy of their
    users and face obsolescence. The geographic information embedded in historic
    routes often surpasses what can be rationally deduced.
  </li>

  <li>
    Trade routes facilitate the emergence of commercial cities. Junction points
    in these routes frequently give birth to cities, especially at intersections
    of waterway routes. Commercial cities often attract the attention of
    political powerhouses. On occasion, these cities can maintain their
    independence, but more often, they come under the sway of dominant political
    entities. When these powers draw resources from significant commercial
    cities and integrate with them, these cities can transform into imperial
    capitals.
  </li>

  <li>
    Political dynamics and the rulers' stance on commerce can influence the rise
    and fall of trade routes. Among several alternative trade routes, the one
    offering the best business environment often becomes dominant. Conversely,
    policies that undermine the business environment can lead to the decline of
    both trade routes and commercial cities.
  </li>
</ul>
