<p><strong>Technological Potential Field</strong></p>

<p>
  In Wuqiao, Hebei, there's a thriving tradition of producing acrobat troupes.
  Yet, performing only in their hometown isn't sustainable. Locals have become
  too accustomed to their acts. To captivate a broader audience and maximize
  earnings, they must venture out and tour other regions.
</p>

<p>
  In ancient Americas, indigenous people crafted sharp blades from obsidian and
  flint. Flint Ridge in Ohio was a prominent source of flint, yet many other
  areas were devoid of it. Consequently, flint from this region was frequently
  traded and transported to various parts of the North American continent—even
  as far as the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico, artifacts made from
  Ohio-sourced flint have been discovered.
</p>

<p>
  In 2003, if I encountered a German in Beijing, there was a high likelihood
  they were an architect. One might wonder, why were so many German architects
  in Beijing? It was because their skills and expertise were in greater demand
  and thus more valued in Beijing than in Germany, where there was already an
  abundance of architectural expertise.
</p>

<p>
  Technology tends to disseminate from regions where it's prevalent to those
  where it's scarce. Various goods and skills follow a similar trend, spreading
  from places of abundance to those of shortage. This diffusion process
  generates immense benefits.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine a stone perched silently atop a mountain. If allowed to roll down, the
  descent releases a tremendous amount of energy. This energy, familiar to us,
  is known as potential energy. In English, "potential energy" refers to the
  power stored when static, only to be released during motion, much like how
  electricity flows from areas of high voltage to those of low voltage.
</p>

<p>
  Likewise, technology and goods possess this inherent potential energy—a
  driving force propelling them towards diffusion and proliferation.
</p>

<p><strong>Theory of Resistance</strong></p>

<p>
  Propagation, like in electrical circuits, faces resistance. Consider the
  peaches from Shenzhou(a smaller city famouse for peachoid produce in North
  China): while there's demand in Shijiazhuang, 100 kilometers away, the 'peach
  potential' isn't realized easily. Traveling on foot with kilos of peaches for
  three days to sell them isn't efficient; the costs outweigh the profits.
  Essentially, the 'resistance' between these places is too high for trade. Only
  with faster transport methods, like mule carts, did this resistance diminish,
  enabling trade. Today, I present a concept: envisioning the world map as a
  circuit diagram.
</p>

<p>
  Regions either have high or low potential. Technologies and goods, akin to
  electric currents, flow from high to low potential areas. This flow's
  resistance is influenced by transportation convenience and efficiency. In
  isolated regions, despite a potential difference, the flow is hindered.
  However, areas with seamless connectivity, despite their physical distance,
  experience strong flows due to low resistance. Over time, these regions
  equilibrate in terms of technology and goods availability. Let's delve into
  this grand flow visualization.
</p>

<p><strong>The Era of Canoeing</strong></p>

<p>
  Human carrying capacity is limited when on foot. Before the advent of
  transportation, only extremely valuable items like flint, obsidian, salt, and
  gems were deemed worth transporting over long distances.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, the earliest invention for substantial transportation was the dugout
  canoe, followed by simple sailboats. The oldest discovered canoe, unearthed in
  the Netherlands, dates back about 10,000 years. Primitive sailboats, seen as
  modifications of the canoe, date back 6,000 years from the Cucuteni-Trypillian
  culture in Ukraine and Romania.
</p>

<p>
  Canoes were revolutionary. Carrying loads on foot over long distances is
  exhausting, but a person in a canoe could transport much larger loads and
  potentially travel faster. Essentially, the canoe reduced "resistance" on
  suitable routes by manyfold. Large sailboats took this further, reducing the
  resistance even more. They turned rivers like the Danube and Nile, and seas
  like the Mediterranean, Baltic, Red, and Arabian seas, into ancient
  'superhighways'.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine ancient humans 10,000 years ago, setting off from Somalia in Africa,
  paddling along the coastline. They'd stop for food or freshwater, or shelter
  during bad weather. How long would it take them to reach the Pearl River
  Delta? Modern humans might take two years with the advantage of money and
  modern amenities. Our ancestors would've been slower. From a technological
  standpoint, five to ten years is feasible. They typically undertook shorter
  journeys due to lack of clear long-distance objectives.
</p>

<p>
  The origin of rice remains a topic of debate. One day the oldest samples are
  found in the Mekong Delta, the next in the Yangtze Delta, followed by even
  older samples in the Pearl River Delta. These discoveries reflect the
  interconnected nature of ancient coastal trade. As a result, similar-aged
  samples are found in all these regions.
</p>

<p>
  Coastal cities might appear distant from each other, spanning thousands of
  kilometers. Yet their trade relations might be tighter than between a coastal
  city and an inland city merely a few hundred kilometers away. The Liangzhu
  culture in Hangzhou has lineage traces to Austronesians (Pacific Islanders and
  Taiwanese). Linguistically, they're believed to be closer to Thai.
</p>

<p><strong>Trade Winds</strong></p>

<p>
  In the subtropics, monsoons, also known as trade winds, reverse direction
  cyclically every year, making annual cyclic voyages convenient.
</p>

<p>
  Actually, 5,000 years ago, how long would it have taken to travel from the
  ancient city of Harrapa by the Indus River in present-day Pakistan to the
  ancient city of Ur in present-day Iraq? Estimated as at most two months.
  Moreover, it's possible to make a round trip within a year, riding with the
  trade winds, efficient and energy-saving. A significant portion of the
  technology in the ancient Indus Valley civilization has to do with the
  exchange with the Mesopotamian civilizations. The maritime spread of this
  technology to the Indus River, 2,000 kilometers away, facilitated the rise of
  the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Their trade connections are evident.
</p>

<p>
  The Mediterranean region benefited greatly from the trade winds. 3,200 years
  ago, the ruins of Phoenician colonies spanned from present-day Lebanon to
  Portugal and Morocco, covering distances of four to five thousand kilometers.
  Yet, they all belonged to the same trade circle and had a comprehensive
  understanding of each other's existence. Ancient Greek city-states weren't
  confined to the Greek peninsula. Closer regions included all the islands in
  the Aegean Sea, Crete, cities on the western coast of Anatolia, Rhodes,
  Cyprus, Brindisi in southern Italy, Taranto, Naples, Syracuse on Sicily.
  Further locations extended to Crimea by the Black Sea in the east and
  Marseille in present-day France in the west, all under the umbrella of Greek
  culture.
</p>

<p>
  During this era, mainstream traded goods included artifacts, fur, amber,
  pearls, and other relatively expensive items. They also traded in bulk
  commodities like grain and olive oil, which made sense to transport via large
  ships. Notably, the tin ore, essential for making bronze tools, was a
  prominent trade item. Making bronze tools required both copper and tin ores.
  While copper ore was somewhat rare, tin ore was even rarer, affecting the
  manufacturing of weapons crucial for a nation's survival. In ancient times,
  tin ore often traveled thousands of kilometers, akin to today's uranium-235—a
  strategic material.
</p>

<p>
  On a serene Earth, one could perceive that the vast expanses of land were akin
  to areas with subtle currents. Yet, it was along coastlines and rivers where
  more dynamic currents took shape. These waterways, vital for navigation,
  breathed life into their surrounding regions, becoming hubs of activity. This
  vibrancy illuminated areas close to water, highlighting them as early cradles
  of civilization, even as large swathes of continental interiors remained
  relatively untouched and mysterious. Consider an Athenian merchant of the
  time: he might have been more acquainted with Rhodes, despite it being a
  considerable distance away, simply because a brief sea voyage would lead him
  there. Meanwhile, Mount Olympus, although closer and a daily sight, might have
  been less explored due to the daunting terrestrial journey it posed. An
  Egyptian familiar with the Nile, stretching a thousand kilometers up and down
  the river, might not like to venture into the desert just a few tens of
  kilometers from the riverbanks. This was the world in which early
  civilizations existed.

<p><strong>The Age of Chariots</strong></p>

<p>
  In ancient times, the vast hinterlands were largely unexplored, with major
  civilizations mainly situated near seas or major rivers. This situation
  changed dramatically due to the introduction of the horse and the invention of
  the wheel.
</p>

<p>
  The wheel's invention dates back around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.
  Archaeological evidence of early wheels has been found almost simultaneously
  in regions like the Mesopotamian basin, the Caucasus, Ukraine, and Romania.
  This suggests that the technology spread rapidly.
</p>

<p>
  Following the invention of the wheel, horses were domesticated. Before horses,
  oxen were used to pull carts. Horses then became a more versatile alternative
  for oxen in hauling carts. The earliest evidence of horse domestication traces
  back over 5,000 years ago in the vast Eurasian steppes, specifically in the
  region north of the Black Sea, present-day Ukraine.
</p>

<p>
  Notably, the aforementioned regions are all closely knit, essentially
  encircling the Black Sea.
</p>

<p>
  The true chariot had wheels with spokes, making it relatively lightweight. If
  one were to map out all the unearthed chariots globally, based on their
  historical timeframes, much like contour lines on a map, the highest point, or
  the earliest occurrence of spoked chariots, would be in Central Asia, in
  today's Russian Federation, near the northwestern region of Kazakhstan,
  specifically around the state of Zintashta-Petrovka.
</p>

<p>
  This area is recognized as the birthplace of chariots. From here, the ancient
  chariot technology spread throughout the world. Around 4,000 years ago,
  starting from this point, it took about 200 years for similar chariots to be
  found throughout Central Asia and the Eurasian steppes. Another 200 years
  later, they reached Mesopotamia, Central Europe, the Indus Valley, the
  Mongolian Plateau, the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and Egypt. By the
  time of King Wu Ding of the Shang Dynasty, 800 years had passed since the
  chariot's initial appearance. Western Europe, the Jianghuai region, and the
  Bengal Delta still had not seen the emergence of chariots.
</p>

<p>
  One can observe that chariots spread more swiftly in arid, open steppes. Their
  transmission was slower in forested areas and downstream marshlands of major
  rivers. In cold mountainous regions, the chariot's presence was virtually
  non-existent.
</p>

<p>
  This is because the tactical advantage of chariot technology was particularly
  evident in the plains. In swamps and forested areas, even though the chariot
  remained an advanced technology, its advantages were diminished, resulting in
  a slower spread.
</p>

<p>
  However, groups mastering chariot technology would modify terrains, like
  forests and marshes, to make them more chariot-friendly. They would drain
  swamps using hydraulic engineering, transforming them into prairie-like
  farmlands. Royal highways were built through forests and mountainous areas,
  facilitating smoother vehicular passage.
</p>

<p><strong>The King's Highway</strong></p>

<p>
  The concept of the King's Highway is one that the Chinese are well acquainted
  with. Dating back to the 3rd century BCE, the famed Qin expressways (秦驰道)
  and straight roads (直道) are testament to this. The expressways connected to
  the provinces and counties of the Qin Empire, serving both military and
  administrative functions. The straight roads led to the Hetao region's Jiuyuan
  county, situated on the southeastern edge of the Eurasian steppe.
</p>

<p>
  However, the concept of the King's Highway is not exclusive to East Asia. The
  Roman roads are clearly a parallel system. The Via Appia, built in 312 BCE,
  predates the Qin's straight roads by a century.
</p>

<p>
  Even earlier, there was the Persian Empire's Royal Road. Historian Herodotus
  documented its construction in the 5th century BCE. However, archaeologists
  believe that its western half was constructed by the ancient Assyrian Empire,
  as early as the 7th century BCE. This Royal Road of the Persian Empire began
  on the eastern shores of the Aegean Sea, traversed challenging passes in
  Turkey, and ascended the 1000-meter-high Gulek Pass. It linked the Assyrian
  capital of Nineveh, present-day in Iraq, with Susa in modern-day Iran,
  stretching southeastward to the Persian capital of Persepolis. This Royal Road
  set the precedent for grand highways around the world. Notably, the Assyrian
  and Persian empires spanned what can be described as the golden age of
  chariots. These vast road networks made the deployment of chariots across
  challenging terrains on a grand scale possible.
</p>

<p><strong>War Horses and the Middle Ages</strong></p>

<p>
  Chariots played a pivotal role in the military expansion across the Eurasian
  continent, leading to the rise of several civilizations. Notable among these
  are the Shang dynasty of China and the Aryan kingdoms of India. The trade
  routes of Central Asia, precursors to the famed Silk Road, developed in this
  context. The Age of Bronze, dominated by chariots, gradually gave way to the
  Iron Age, where cavalry began to assert its dominance. This transition was
  evolutionary rather than sudden.
</p>

<p>
  The progression from the initial introduction of cavalry to its maturity
  required a series of technological breakthroughs. For instance, only small
  horses were suitable for pulling carts. Armored knights required larger,
  stronger horses to bear the weight of both the rider and the armor.
</p>

<p>
  Advancements like the saddle, stirrups, and spurs enhanced the combat prowess
  of knights. By the time of the Five Barbarians and Sixteen Kingdoms, around
  the 4th century, these technologies were essentially mature. This period is a
  critical juncture, marking the boundary between ancient and medieval
  histories. The nomadic tribes from the Eurasian steppes, possessing vast
  numbers of war horses and formidable cavalry, toppled mighty empires like the
  Wei-Jin and Roman in a relatively short time frame.
</p>

<p>
  The best-equipped cavalry legion in East Asian medieval history can be traced
  back to the fictional Murong Fu in Jin Yong's novels. However, his real-life
  counterparts—the armored cavalry of the Murong Xianbei and the Tuoba Xianbei
  during the Sixteen Kingdoms period—were unparalleled in subsequent
  generations. Their weaponry and armor shared lineage or influence prevalent
  across the Eurasian steppes, stretching from Omsk in Russia to the grasslands
  of Ukraine. During this era, Inner Asia undeniably became one of the world's
  focal points. From this point until the Mongol Empire's zenith, the trade
  routes of the Eurasian steppes, Central Asia, and North Asia were continually
  revitalized, birthing many significant cities and states during the Middle
  Ages.
</p>

<p><strong>Grassland Highways</strong></p>

<p>
  The transportation capabilities of horses and vehicles are ten times greater
  than human power, and their speed is even faster. This reduced the resistance
  within the Eurasian hinterland to just a tenth. During his military campaigns
  along the Black Sea, the Mongolian general Subutai reportedly slept on
  horseback and covered 2,000 kilometers in just a week. This remarkable pace
  has led to the legend of the "600-li express". It's akin to treating oneself
  as a courier package. The distance from Mongolia to the banks of Russia's
  Volga River spans more than 4,000 kilometers. Given such a riding pace, one
  could traverse the entire Eurasian steppe in just half a month. Although such
  a feat would be exhausting, in reality, using only a tenth of that speed,
  covering this distance in about six months is more realistic.
</p>

<p>
  While the carrying capacity of horse-drawn carriages and horses might be
  lesser than that of ships, their speed is comparable. Furthermore, they can
  access a wider range of terrains.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, during Inner Asia's golden era, the famous Silk Road did not transport
  bulk goods that were usually carried by Mediterranean ships. Instead, it
  mainly facilitated the movement of luxury goods, precious metals, and
  weapons—high-value items. Heavy commodities were still majorly transported via
  seas, rivers, and canals. Yet, the grassland trade routes were exceptional in
  disseminating technology, especially military tech.
</p>

<p>
  Cities such as Darius the Great's capital, Samarkand, Bukhara, Khotan, Kucha,
  and Chang'an, became pivotal hubs for medieval global trade.
</p>

<p>
  Along the route from Constantinople to Chang'an or Ye City, many great empires
  emerged. To the west, there were the Sassanid Persian Empire, Abbasid
  Caliphate, Seljuk Empire, Ottoman Empire, Khwarezmian dynasty, and the Western
  Liao. To the east, the Former Qin Empire, Xianbei, Sui and Tang dynasties,
  Liao, Jin, Western Xia, and Mongol Empire made their mark. Their rise was
  deeply tied to controlling the grassland trade routes and mastering advanced
  military techniques.
</p>

<p>
  During the medieval period, the Eurasian steppe functioned as the world's
  largest highway and technology exchange center. A plethora of Central Asian
  products, techniques, and cultures flowed to East Asia during this window of
  opportunity. One can visualize a cosmopolitan Chang'an—diverse in languages,
  religions, ethnicities, and heavily influenced by Persian aesthetics.
