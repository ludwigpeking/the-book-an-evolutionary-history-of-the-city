<h1>06 A Game of Casting Risks, the Calculation on Castle Building</h1>
<p></p>

<p>Now, I will delve into the discourse of castles.</p>

<p>
  While palpable remnants of fortresses like Qianmen Gate Tower in Beijing, the
  city walls and gates of Xi'an and Nanjing are prominent, a significant portion
  of the Chinese populace may not view the castle as a recurrent urban landscape
  (in contrast to Europe or Japan).
</p>

<p>
  Indeed, within the borders of China, a multitude of castles have been built
  historically. We know that many noble families of the Han dynasty had
  fortresses, and numerous clay fortress models have been found in Han tombs;
  many local magnates in later dynasties also constructed fortresses, some of
  their designs bear an resemblance to those of Norman castles. Even today place
  names designated as a certain fortress or stockade are still common.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the majority of these ancient fortresses have unfortunately
  succumbed to the passage of time. Nonetheless, even today, castles can still
  be glimpsed in China:
</p>

<p>
  For instance, the weisuos( guard camps) of the Ming dynasty, characterized by
  its rather simplistic block design, traces of which can still be witnessed in
  places like Yantai and Xiamen( Amoi). The renowned Kowloon Walled City of
  Hongkong, which has since been dismantled, was one such fortress. These weisuo
  fortresses are relatively low in military engineering sophistication, with
  designs that are monotonous and elementary.

<p>
  Another type comprises various local fortresses constructed by local
  chieftains, landlords, and village collectives. They typically utilize the
  natural terrain, and their designs are richer and more complex. The most
  well-known among these are probably the earthen buildings ( tulous) of
  Zhangzhou in Fujian, and the diaolou clusters in Kaiping, Canton. This
  category of local fortresses, albeit numerous, tend to be smaller in scale and
  are often situated in regions where the imperial order could not reach, hence
  exhibiting a pronounced need for organized-self-defense among the locals.

<p>
  Such places are generally remote from large cities, hence the presence of
  these fortresses may not be particularly conspicuous.
</p>

<p>
  The existence of castles, however, is far more overt in Europe. Countless
  cities, such as Edinburgh, Budapest, and Lisbon, are dominated by their
  imposing castle skylines. In England, Wales, along the Rhine or in the
  Apennine Mountains, the remnants of various fortresses from successive
  dynasties are so numerous and densely scattered that they are within mutual
  sight. While there are many ancient castles among those currently standing in
  Europe, most were constructed after the 11th century.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  In cities across Japan, irrespective of their size, it is typical to find one
  or several remnants of castles. According to a statistic I came across, there
  exist over 100 various castles in contemporary Japan, while historically, the
  number surpasses 5000. Japanese castles primarily emerged within a relatively
  concentrated time frame that was later than their European counterparts, with
  the majority erected during the 16th century. This was a period subsequent to
  the import of European technology during the Age of Exploration, and before
  the Tokugawa shogunate's policy of self isolation.
</p>

<p>
  The best-preserved castles in Japan today, such as Kumamoto Castle and Himeji
  Castle, which I have had the opportunity to visit, are renowned for their
  massive earthworks and architectural scale, as well as the intricacy of their
  military technological details. They suggest a serious preparation for
  extensive warfare. The original owners of these two fortresses were not
  Japan's most powerful lords; for a feudal city-state with a population merely
  ranging from tens of thousands to a few hundred thousand, the commitment and
  expenditure involved in such construction projects is truly astounding.
</p>

<p>
  One may glean an impression that, barring new world countries like the United
  States, the Old World's developed countries seem to abound in castles.
  <strong
    >The more developed is the country, the more abundant are its
    castles.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  From an empirical perspective, one could even propose a hypothesis: Could the
  construction of castles in every village have stimulated development?
</p>

<p>How should we interpret this phenomenon?</p>

<p>Aren't castles symbols of warfare and militarism?</p>

<p>
  Feudal lords in Europe and Japan were considerably impoverished compared to
  the great monarchs and emperors of China and India. Yet, even without the
  pressing threat of imminent warfare, they were willing to refrain themselves
  on other expensese, accumulate massive debt, all to build their formidable
  fortresses.
</p>

<p>Certainly, these efforts were not in vain.</p>

<p>Let us examine how castles altered the political climate of city-states:</p>

<p>
  For any monarch aiming to seize another's castle, the calculation required is
  analogous to that of a modern company undertaking a merger or acquisition.
</p>

<p>
  He would have to evaluate the costs and benefits. Seizing a castle would yield
  an additional source of income. However, the process of seizing also entails
  costs. Having acquired another's company, if you wish to gain genuine control,
  it necessitates the restructuring of its management, an action which incurs
  substantial costs.
</p>

<p>
  To forcibly capture a city-state generally requires having military forces
  several times larger than the opponent's, as the radius of your siege circle
  is significantly larger than the opponent's defense circle. This vast width
  necessitates a much larger number of soldiers. Furthermore, while besieging
  the opponent's city, you also need to construct earthworks around the city to
  prevent surprise attacks, typically beyond the range of the city's defenses
  projectiles. This enlarges the radius of the siege works. Although possibly
  far more rudimentary than a permanent castle, features like ditches, walls,
  and watchtowers are generally indispensable. All of this roughly amounts to
  the cost of constructing half a castle.
</p>

<p>
  You must also be prepared to counter potential reinforcements attacking from
  behind. Sometimes, behind the besieging troops, another line of defensive
  works is constructed, akin to building a larger ring fortress outside the
  opponent's city.
</p>

<p>This forms the standard configuration for a siege.</p>

<p>
  In 52 BC, Caesar commanded the Roman legions to besiege the Gauls in Alesia.
  The perimeter of the Gauls' fortress was approximately two to three
  kilometers; Caesar surrounded it and built the first ring of siege works,
  termed 'circumvallation', spanning 16 kilometers, composed of trenches, walls,
  and watchtowers, to prevent enemy breakouts from the city. Then, to block the
  Gauls' reinforcements from outside, the Roman legions constructed another
  21-kilometer long defensive work called 'contravallation'. This secured
  Caesar's 70,000 besieging troops between the two walls and put the Gauls of
  Alesia under a long-term siege.
</p>

<p>
  Caesar's case was successful. He first defeated the Gauls' reinforcements
  relying on the fortress and then, as the Gauls inside Alesia were numerous but
  their food supplies limited and breakout attempts hopeless, they could not
  outlast Caesar and eventually surrendered.
</p>

<p>
  However, in most cases, a castle would not house too many people. It would
  have a well for secured drinking water supply and food storage to last for
  years. If you use tens of thousands of people to besiege a few thousand inside
  the castle for months, with the cost being ten times that of the enemy, it
  would not be economically beneficial even if you take the stronghold
  eventually.
</p>

<p>
  In 1565, the Ottoman Empire's navy carried 40,000 soldiers to land on the
  island of Malta. The defenders were the 600 Knights Hospitaller from Malta and
  over 2,000 soldiers from various Christian countries in Europe, along with
  3,000 armed islanders, totaling six to seven thousand. After four months of
  siege, although the defenders were exhausted and reduced in number, the
  Ottoman army had also suffered over half casualties, and infectious diseases
  were rampant. When the European reinforcements landed on Malta, the Ottoman
  Empire had to retreat.
</p>

<p>
  To take a castle, you need a significant political advantage, material
  reserves, and be prepared to pay a high cost. Failure means mutual loss, with
  the besieging party's cost being many times that of the defenders.
</p>

<p>
  For any monarch of any major country, mobilizing 40,000 fully-armed soldiers
  to besiege a city-state for a year and a half is a major undertaking that
  could easily cause political fluctuations and unforeseeable risks. Such
  actions cannot be frequently undertaken. Generally, forcibly occupying a city
  will be economically disadvantageous unless there is a particularly strong
  political significance. Attacks on castles are rarely forced; in the English
  Wars of the Roses, the red and white armies often bypassed enemy castles and
  rarely dared to storm them.
</p>

<p>
  The essence of a castle, obviously, is not for someone to attack; on the
  contrary, its existence is to prevent attacks, so it must be intimidating and
  appear strong.
</p>

<p>
  Today, in architecture, a coating that looks like stone is often used to paint
  the exterior walls, making it look more expensive. This technique can be said
  to be a completely traditional craft, because a thousand years ago, knights in
  England were painting coatings on wooden castles to disguise them as stone
  castles.
</p>

<p>
  If you are a lord, what you have to do is to let everyone know that it's a
  losing deal to forcefully take your castle. If your territory generates a
  profit of $1,000,000 a year, then, according to the investment market
  valuation, your valuation might be $15,000,000. What you need to ensure is
  that the cost for your opponent to take your castle exceeds $15,000,000.
</p>

<p>
  For example, you could say to your adversaries: "Let me tell you, this piece
  of land of mine garners at most £1,000,000 in tax revenue per year. I have
  spent £5,000,000 over five years, living frugally, to build this castle. If
  you want to conquer me, you must spend at least £50,000,000. Certainly, you
  don't have £50,000,000. If you borrow it from the Bank of England, they would
  charge you £5,000,000 in interest per year, making your venture a guaranteed
  loss. However, if you decide to make peace with me, I can provide you with 50
  smoked swans each year as a tribute. So, I suggest you consider my
  proposition."
</p>

<p>
  Thus, a castle may appear to be a military hardware at first glance, but in
  fact, it is a peacekeeping and order-maintaining instrument. In reality, most
  castles in Europe have never been assaulted. In countries densely dotted with
  castles, like France during the Middle Ages, the nation was fundamentally
  structured from the ground up, as described by Machiavelli, such a country is
  hard to destroy. Even if the royal family perishes, the essence of the country
  still exists in its thousands of rural castles, and national order can be
  easily restored from them. On the contrary, like Darius of Persia, in a
  country lacking militarily independent city-states, once the emperor falls,
  the imperial structure crumbles, quickly falling into Alexander's hands.
</p>

<p>
  Constructing a castle does carry significant costs, but it serves as a
  resource for stability. It's much more economically feasible than enduring
  catastrophic warfare and totalitarian oppression.
</p>

<p>
  How to design a castle using the least amount of money, yet imposing a
  significant cost on the opponent, that is the art of castle building.
</p>

<p>
  In this episode, I introduce the basic form of castles, which encapsulates the
  fundamental principles of castle construction.
</p>

<p>
  This is the straightforward design known as the "Motte and Bailey,"
  constructed by the Normans in the 10th and 11th centuries across France and
  the Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
  These are two peculiar French-like terms that lack corresponding words in
  Chinese. You could refer to them as "high fortress and ground fortress."
  However, using the familiar Japanese terminology may be more explanatory -
  they're equivalent to Honmaru and Ninomaru.
</p>

<p>
  Assume you're a baron or a similarly ranked landlord, you could find a steep
  little hill within your territory; if you can't find one, you could pile up
  soil yourself, the higher the better. This is your Motte, the high fortress or
  Honmaru. You could dig soil around the hill in a circle and pile it up in the
  middle, hence while piling up the soil, you're also digging a trench. The edge
  of the slope should be vertical to prevent anyone from climbing it with bare
  hands. A wall is then built on top of the earthen slope. Inside the wall is a
  tall tower, called a "Keep" in English, or a "Tenshukaku" (Castle Tower)
  following Japanese terminology. From the Tenshukaku, you can overlook several
  to tens of kilometers, ideally marking your territory visible at your land's
  border.
</p>

<p>
  The ground floor of the Tenshukaku is typically a warehouse, kitchen, and
  granary. It also stores wine, which could serve as a long-term consumable if
  there's no fresh water source - water stored long-term was hazzardous.
</p>

<p>
  As an aside, the word "chateau" used for wineries comes from French,
  equivalent to the English "castle," hence winemaking and wine storage were
  common functions of a castle.
</p>

<p>
  Back to the Tenshukaku, the middle floor is where the master and his family
  reside. In any ancient European castle you visit, the master resides on the
  second floor( or first floor per British english).
</p>

<p>The attic or top floor houses the service staff and sentries.</p>

<p>
  Sometimes, there can be more than three floors, with four or five layers,
  including a basement, a treasury, and a prison for holding important
  prisoners. In the War of the Roses, for example, opposing kings like Henry VI
  were confined in the Tower of London. The highest part of the Tower of London
  is called the White Tower, which is a Keep or Tenshukaku.
</p>

<p>
  The area of the Motte or Honmaru is often very small, only a few hundred to a
  few thousand square meters, unless for a Shogun or the Emperor of Ming with
  many wives, then he would need tens of thousands of square meters inside your
  Honmaru to accommodate his harem. However, for a small landlord, the Honmaru
  and the Tenshukaku are never large.
</p>

<p>
  To accommodate other functions, a larger courtyard must be built in addition
  to the Motte or Honmaru. This courtyard, slightly higher than the ground
  level, has its own wall and trench, and its own arrow towers on the wall. This
  is referred to as the Bailey, the lower fortress, or Ninomaru.
</p>

  <div__wrapper">https://youtu.be/Y0DlPiZ-MF4</div>
</figure>

<p>
  Between the Ninomaru and the Honmaru, there is also a trench, and one must
  cross a bridge and climb steep steps to reach the Honmaru. This is normally
  the only route to the Honmaru.
</p>

<p>Inside the Ninomaru, there's typically:</p>

<p>
  <strong>A well</strong>—this is crucial; every castle needs an independent
  water source, unaffected and unharmed by outside enemies. Even if a castle is
  located on a hill, it's usually a small hill, as very few are located on high
  mountains. This is mainly due to the limited access to fresh water.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>A blacksmith</strong> for weaponery, and more often just for weapon
  repair.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>A stable</strong>, as a small castle usually houses a few cavalrymen.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>A hall</strong>: it serves as a court, a meeting room, and a banquet
  hall.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>A chapel:</strong> for conducting ideological and political work.
  Several soldier dormitories.
</p>

<p><strong>A market </strong>sometimes<strong>t</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Layered Defense</strong></p>

<p>
  The Bailey, ground castle or Ninomaru, is the same concept with three names.
  So is the motte, high castle or Honmaru.
</p>

<p>
  The Ninomaru is larger in diameter and lower than the Honmaru, making it
  easier for enemies to breach. But even if enemies break through the Ninomaru,
  it's not yet the end. Those defending the castle can all retreat to the
  Honmaru. With the stored food and wine there, they can hold out for several
  months.
</p>

<p>
  All that can be damaged in the Ninomaru are most building assets. There are no
  treasures, important figures, or prisoners.
</p>

<p>
  Also, the entire interior of Ninomaru is exposed to the range of the Honmaru.
  Those in the Honmaru have the advantage of height, making it significantly
  advantageous to hit those below. Therefore, even if the attackers invade the
  Ninomaru, they can't hold it. They are very likely to be repelled by the
  defending army from above.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to end the battle, you still need to have the ability to breach
  the Honmaru and storm the Tenshukaku.
</p>

<p>
  The Motte, Tenshukaku, and Honmaru - only occupy 20% of the total castle area,
  requiring only a few people for defense, but the shooting range is 100%. Its
  defense is 100%, range 100%, requiring over half of the total cost of the
  castle. It can be defended by a small but loyal troop.
</p>

<p>
  The Bailey, or Ninomaru - occupies 80% of the castle area and extensive
  functionality, but only costs the rest half of the total. Its defense is
  weaker, but it's sufficient to ward off 90% of the most common mobs and
  bandits. When the enemy is particularly strong, the Ninomaru can be abandoned
  without leading to a total defeat.
</p>

<p>The Motte and Bailey model has various modifications.</p>

<p>
  This structure can be expanded and upgraded. If the Ninomaru is not enough, it
  can be expanded layer after layer, with outer layers like the Sannomaru,
  Nishinomaru, Kitanomaru..(third, west, and north enclosures...), setting up
  multiple barriers for the enemy, forming a snail-like structure. The moat can
  change from one ring to two. The wall can change from one layer to two, and
  two to three. However, the outer wall must be shorter than the inner one. The
  deeper the defense, the more solid and expensive it is. 80% of the cost is
  used to deal with 20% of the most vicious enemies, while 20% of the cost
  covers 80% of the functions.
</p>

<p>
  To protect the merchants and industrialists affiliated with the nobility, the
  outermost wall encompasses the civilian blocks. Because this is the lowest
  part within the city, it's referred to as the down town.
</p>

<p>1) Cost Logic:</p>

<p>
  If you spend one unit of currency, you can get a checkpoint with a 50%
  probability of successful defense; however, if you spend another unit of
  currency, you won't get a 100% success rate, maybe just 70%. When you spend
  three units of currency, you get an 80% successful defense rate checkpoint.
  The marginal benefit is diminishing.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, it's better to spend the same three units of currency on creating three
  checkpoints, each with a 50% successful defense rate. In this case, the
  enemy's success rate of breaking through all checkpoints is the cube of 50%,
  i.e., 12.5%. This means that the overall success rate of your defense is
  87.5%.
</p>

<p>This is why advanced castles are layered with checkpoints and traps.</p>

<p>
  The simple city walls like those in Ming Dynasty county cities, which are just
  a single layer, are mainly for dealing with bandits and civilians.
</p>

<p>
  In theory, you could make the entire city as grand and sturdy as the
  Tenshukaku, but that would be too expensive. Besides, your resources are
  finite. With the same expenditure, this would inevitably not be the plan
  covering the maximum defensive area. If you only adhere to the standards of
  the Ninomaru, the defense ability is too lax. The safety threshold your total
  investment achieves is too low. Therefore, you must strategically invest your
  funds. The same goes for real estate; the interior and exterior of a
  residential complex's gate, areas frequently passed by people, can be
  decorated with expensive and exquisite landscaping. However, other parts of
  the complex can use modest lawns and plants. The first and second layers of a
  building's exterior walls, parts that people can view up close, should use the
  most expensive materials; but the higher parts can use cost-saving materials,
  as long as they look good from a distance. This is a general principle of cost
  allocation.
</p>

<p>
  2) Customer Perspective: The customers of the castle are the invaders. Among
  them, small thieves are very common, and the castle as a whole needs to be
  unshakeable in the face of such petty rebellions; powerful enemies that could
  annihilate a country are rare. When facing such formidable enemies, it's
  inevitable to suffer minor losses, but you should be able to maintain your
  core territory. If you aim not to suffer any loss in the face of a powerful
  enemy, the cost would be unbearable.
</p>

<p>
  3) Loyalty Structure: The same applies to your team. Those most loyal to you,
  ready to die for your country, are few, so don't expect many people to hold
  your final position for you. You need a small, loyal, and efficient team to
  defend a small but formidable stronghold. The majority of the less important
  facilities can only be guarded by peripheral followers.
</p>

<p>
  4) Irreversible Structure: All cities with three layers of city walls have the
  inner wall taller than the outer one. The outer face of the city wall has
  extensive protections, while the inward direction is mostly exposed. Enemies
  may occupy the outer wall, but before they can enter the inner wall, they must
  cross a deadly trap.
</p>

<p>
  Castles come in various sizes, but this layered structure is the most mature
  pattern in history.
</p>

<p>
  I often talk about Rome's Palatine Hill and Capitoline Hill. The Capitoline
  Hill is small but high; the Palatine Hill is large but low. The two are
  adjacent, separated by a moat.
</p>

<p>
  Isn't this the Motte and Bailey structure? Capitoline Hill is clearly Rome's
  high castle. In reality, Rome was rarely attacked. The only time it fell was
  in 390 BC when the Gallic army occupied most of the city. At that time, Rome's
  young soldiers retreated to the narrow top of Capitoline Hill, where they held
  out for seven months. The Gauls eventually withdrew without capturing this
  high fort.
</p>
