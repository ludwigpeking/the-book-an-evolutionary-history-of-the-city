<h1>29 Top-level Design</h1>

<p>
  This lecture series, from Session 9 to Session 26, revolves around the
  dynamics of urban evolution. From Session 27 onwards, I will dedicate several
  sessions to discuss issues related to the morphology of urban evolution. In
  this context, there's an excellent book titled "The City Shaped" by Spiro
  Kostof. This book has been a significant influence and inspiration to me. The
  book offers a comprehensive discussion on the conditions for top-down design,
  the origin of ideas, and approaches. In urban history, decisions made by
  various small entities based on their own perspectives have been the
  predominant way of building. For example, village farmers mainly decide the
  designs of their homes. Commercial complexes and residential areas are
  primarily developed by organizations based on market needs. Even institutions
  such as universities, churches, hospitals, and government buildings are
  usually constructed based on their individual needs.
</p>

<p>
  However, occasionally, some decisions are made rapidly and may influence the
  course of events for centuries or even millennia. The most common hallmark of
  such top-down designs is the grid road network, though other designs do exist
  but are less prevalent.
</p>

<p>
  Scenarios demanding top-down designs can generally be categorized into three
  situations:
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >1) Post-disaster reconstruction<br />2) Colonial development<br />3) Rapid
    urbanization due to economic and technological booms</strong
  >
</p>

<p>Let's delve into each:</p>

<p>
  1) <strong>Post-Disaster Reconstruction</strong>:<br />Areas in the river
  civilizations often face floods. After floods, the deposited silt would often
  blur the boundaries of farmlands, making ownership delineations unclear. This
  requires someone knowledgeable in mathematics, typically a priest, to
  re-delineate these boundaries. Such geometric divisions usually result in
  rectangular plots, resembling a chessboard. If developed, houses built on
  these plots would inherit this grid pattern, and the original pathways between
  farmlands become roads. This grid isn't necessarily perpendicular and often
  adapts to the landscape. For instance, settlements along the Nile in Egypt
  have been built following this grid pattern, and Cairo still exhibits this
  layout today.
</p>

<p>
  New York's West Village, with its distinctive street layout, also evolved from
  farmland grids, making it deviate from the general grid pattern of the city
  and bear a resemblance to Cairo.
</p>

<p>
  Valletta in Malta, a medieval city with a strict grid layout, was rebuilt
  after a devastating four-month siege in 1565. After the city was bombarded
  with 130,000 cannonballs by the Turks, it was heavily funded by Europe to be
  reconstructed in a new location with better defenses.
</p>

<p>
  London, with its intricate and winding streets formed over two millennia, once
  had a chance to be redesigned after the Great Fire of 1666 which destroyed
  two-thirds of the city. Plans were proposed to reorganize the streets into a
  more structured layout, but these plans met with fierce opposition from
  landowners as it would alter property boundaries extensively.
</p>

<p>
  Both the cities built in the 6th century – Chang'an during the Sui and Tang
  Dynasties and Yuan Dadu in the 13th century – are classic examples of top-down
  design with a typical grid layout. Both cities were constructed adjacent to
  their older counterparts – Han Chang'an and Jin Zhongdu – due to the
  contamination of groundwater over time rendering the well water undrinkable.
  In a way, this can be viewed as reconstruction in response to an environmental
  disaster.
</p>

<p><strong>Case 2: Colonial Development.</strong></p>

<p>
  The most developed grid network can be found in the United States, which is
  not surprising. When European colonizers arrived in North America, their
  military power easily overwhelmed the indigenous peoples. With little
  resistance, they gained control of vast tracts of land, treating it much like
  a blank slate upon which they could freely plan, without many constraints.
</p>

<p>
  When dividing the land, what shape did the colonizers choose? Naturally, they
  divided the land into uniform squares, which made it easier to measure, value,
  sell, or resell. Moreover, the fundamental shape of a house is square, making
  it convenient to lay out on a square plot. This checkerboard layout resonated
  with the colonial community's ideals of equality.
</p>

<p>
  As a result, we can observe grid cities like Philadelphia and Savannah that
  were designed top-down.
</p>

<p>
  The epitome of this grid system was the Public Land Survey System (PLSS)
  proposed in 1785 by Thomas Jefferson, who was yet to become president. He
  suggested dividing the vast lands of the Midwest into enormous grids, each one
  mile square. This grid spanned thousands of miles. However, since the Earth
  isn't flat, these square plots would become slightly trapezoidal over large
  distances, hence requiring periodic adjustments to the grid. As a result, many
  roads and property lines in the Midwest still adhere to this pattern. Major
  cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Minneapolis adjusted their
  grids according to natural features like rivers, but there are exceptions like
  Chicago, which followed the PLSS grid. In terms of visionary planning, few can
  rival Jefferson, who, aside from drafting the Declaration of Independence and
  becoming president, left a lasting mark on America's landscape.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, colonialism isn't unique to Western civilization. Ancient civilizations
  also practiced it.
</p>

<p>
  Around 4600 years ago, Mohenjo-Daro, an ancient city of the Indus Valley
  Civilization, was meticulously planned with a grid network. This reveals that
  the civilization was possibly established by a foreign entity, bringing with
  it unprecedented technologies and military prowess, aiming for rapid and
  uniform development.
</p>

<p>
  In European cities like Florence, Vienna, and Lucca, we often notice a small,
  square area at the city's heart, juxtaposed with a radiating spiderweb
  pattern. These are remnants of Roman military camps. At the height of the
  Roman Empire, hundreds of such camps dotted Western Europe and the
  Mediterranean, housing 44 legions and 400 auxiliary units. These camps and
  connecting roads secured trade routes, ensured tax collection, and maintained
  order.
</p>

<p>
  The Roman camps were standardized fortresses. Their benefits included
  standardized designs, construction procedures, and budgets. Troops moving
  between these camps could easily adopt standard defensive strategies. These
  fortified sites often became regional trade hubs and eventually evolved into
  cities.
</p>

<p>
  In China, there are similar street patterns, like in Yantai's Zhifu district,
  which features a square layout with a cross-shaped main street. This is the
  remnant of a Ming Dynasty coastal fortress. Similar patterns can be seen in
  Tianjin, Xiamen, Shenyang, and Kowloon in Hong Kong. The Ming Dynasty left
  hundreds of such fortresses, called "Wei So," which bear an 80% resemblance to
  Roman camps, serving similar functions.
</p>

<p>
  During its gradual domination, the Ming Dynasty built these fortresses to
  suppress remnants of the Mongol Empire and local armed groups. This
  standardization in military architecture dates back to the Zhou Dynasty in
  China.
</p>

<p>
  Every architecture student in China learns about the "Artisan State" from the
  "Zhou Rituals". The Zhou princes and the indigenous inhabitants had a unique
  relationship, akin to military colonization. These fortified states were
  constructed and managed by the Zhou aristocracy, serving as outposts for
  defense, diplomacy, and administration—similar to Roman camps but with a
  different administrative structure.
</p>

<p>
  The description in the "Zhou Rituals" especially emphasizes the width of roads
  for chariot movement, suggesting its creation during the Spring and Autumn
  period. Like Roman camps, these Zhou fortresses contained temples, markets,
  and assembly areas, all organized in a grid. Over time, as settlers
  integrated, these fortified areas either expanded, blending with the organic
  layout of surrounding settlements, or disintegrated.
</p>

<p>
  Taking Lucca as an example, it has preserved the Roman grid layout with minor
  disintegration. The Y-shaped streets on the east and north sides developed
  alongside old outer roads, later integrated into Renaissance-era walls. Beyond
  the walls, roads radiated outwards from the city gates.

    >Case 3:
    <strong
      >Rapid urbanization due to economic and technological booms</strong
    ></strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  When there is a leap in economic and technological development, there is a
  sudden influx of new urban population and capital, flooding into previously
  low-valued land.
</p>

<p>
  Such situations often stimulate the development of new cities and lead to land
  speculation.
</p>

<p>
  This bears some similarities to colonial activities. Colonialism itself often
  coincided with the introduction of new technologies into areas that were
  technologically underdeveloped, resulting in rapid development and
  urbanization.
</p>

<p>
  In historical contexts, there were specific periods, for example, in the late
  19th century when the West entered the industrialization phase. Major European
  cities began to see the emergence of new districts in their peripheries.
</p>

<p>
  During this era in Barcelona, the new district named Eixample was particularly
  representative and expansive, covering approximately 7.5 square kilometers.
</p>

<p>
  The grid system in New York's Manhattan came slightly before Barcelona's
  expansion. It can also be considered a product of this era. It wasn't a
  remnant of the early Dutch colonization. In fact, early New York was centered
  around the Financial District downtown, where the road network was much more
  intricate. The large, consistent, and homogenous streets north of 14th Street
  were planned in the early 19th century by the committee formed by Morris,
  Rutherford, and DeWitt. This design was a reaction to the post-revolutionary
  influx of immigrants and active real estate speculation in the United States.
</p>

<p>
  After World War II in the 20th century, there was another peak in top-down
  urban planning. The UK, France, Japan, Brazil, and India all experimented with
  new urban designs, primarily based on modernist design principles. However,
  these experiments resulted in a few less than successful cases. By the 1980s,
  in the US and UK, there was a resurgence of urban planning led by the New
  Urbanism movement. New Urbanism emphasizes a more coordinated approach. New
  York's Battery Park City and London's Canary Wharf are among the more
  influential and positively viewed examples.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, none of these economic leaps compare to the intensity seen in China
  at the beginning of the 21st century. China's economic surge was massive,
  involving an enormous population. In 1850, the total population of Europe was
  only 120 million, and the US had just 23 million. By 2000, China's population
  was 1.3 billion. In China, new districts larger than Midtown Manhattan emerged
  by the hundreds, almost all of them adopting a very orderly road network
  structure. This marked a significant chapter in urban history.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, we discussed three scenarios: post-disaster reconstruction,
  colonial activity, and rapid urbanization. These represent times when top-down
  urban planning is most prevalent, reflecting a society where power, resources,
  and knowledge are concentrated at the top.
</p>

<p>
  In societies experiencing steady development, top-down designs are less
  common. However, in societies undergoing significant change, it becomes a
  necessity.
</p>

<p>
  In modern times, the proportion of top-down designs is increasing. With
  advancements in technology and the accumulation of knowledge, the quality of
  these designs is improving, leading to more comprehensive information, better
  coordination, and less arbitrariness. However, in societies where power is
  highly concentrated, experts often become silent or inactive, leading to more
  arbitrary decisions and a decline in technical quality.
</p>

<p>
  Top-down designs are typically temporary. Over a millennium, there might be
  just a few instances, each lasting only a few years or decades. For over 90%
  of the time, cities tend to revert to spontaneous construction activities,
  which are more sensitive to environmental changes. These spontaneous
  activities, especially in situations where existing authority wanes,
  continually and gradually modify and optimize the original top-down design,
  enhancing its efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  However, the influence of top-down designs is profound. Their established
  trajectories create path dependencies that persist for generations. For
  example, modern Beijing still uses streets designed during the Yuan dynasty,
  and these roads show no signs of erosion or dissolution, retaining their
  vitality.
</p>

<p>
  The techniques of top-down designs are diverse, not just limited to grid
  systems. Their inspirations and methodologies vary widely, which we can delve
  into further in subsequent discussions.
