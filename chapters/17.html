<p>
  Next, I want to talk about commercial facilities in cities. To truly
  understand the nature of commercial facilities, it's essential to clarify some
  basic issues, as our most natural assumptions may not align with reality.
</p>

<p>
  Let's start by considering a single unit of commerce, which can be likened to
  a cell. For example, let's think about a pancake stall.
</p>

<p>
  What is the worst-case scenario for a pancake stall? Presumably, it's having
  no customers.
</p>

<p>
  What's the next worst thing? Perhaps it would be another pancake stall selling
  the exact same pancakes setting up shop right next to it.
</p>

<p>
  The following question is: what happens if a bun stall opens next to the
  pancake stall? What's the relationship between buns and pancakes?
</p>

<p>
  On the surface, a bun stall might siphon off some customers who initially
  wanted pancakes. However, the opposite could also occur; customers who
  intended to buy buns might end up choosing pancakes. Alternatively, some
  customers might decide to purchase both.
</p>

<p>
  Despite the apparent competitive relationship, these stalls could also be
  attracting customers for one another. Some customers may have a
  straightforward idea: they just want breakfast. Knowing that they can find a
  variety of breakfast options at a particular location, they choose to go
  there. They might not have a specific preference in mind when setting off,
  only making a choice when they see the range of options available. In
  contrast, if only one type of breakfast is offered, they might decide not to
  go at all.
</p>

<p>
  The increase in product variety enhances the destination's appeal, drawing
  more customers to the area. This dual role of competition and mutual
  attraction among businesses is crucial for understanding the intricate
  dynamics of commercial spaces in urban settings.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Adjacent stores can either harm or benefit each other. Both dynamics coexist,
  making it challenging to determine which is more prominent. But don't worry;
  if two shops severely undermine each other, one or both will likely shut down
  or pivot to a different business, thereby ending their symbiotic relationship.
  Conversely, if they create a mutually beneficial setting, their symbiosis
  could grow into a more complex and large-scale community.
</p>

<p>
  In real life, a woman might initially intend to buy Chanel but then switch to
  the neighboring Louis Vuitton. This is common and reflects why these luxury
  brands often choose to locate near each other. The draw of a shopping area
  with multiple luxury brands like Chanel, LV, Dior, and Prada is much more
  significant than a standalone store. So even if Chanel has to share its
  customer base, it's beneficial to be part of such a community.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, opening a pancake stand identical to one next door may seem
  like a spiteful move, but it's not necessarily disadvantageous. If the
  customer demand is high and one stand can't meet it, the second stand
  increases the supply and efficiency. If one vendor is absent, the other
  provides continuity, stabilizing the supply and increasing the number of
  customers who are willing to buy pancakes.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, two similar pancake stands can assist each other. For example, if
  one runs out of eggs, it can borrow from the other. This sharing extends to
  other supplies, optimizing the logistics and reducing costs. In doing so, they
  don't have to individually manage every supply channel and can divide labor,
  saving time.
</p>

<p>
  Another interesting point is that when a person wants to buy a pancake but is
  hesitant because he finds it expensive at one stand, seeing the same price at
  another stand often convinces him to make the purchase. This increases market
  transparency, facilitating transactions and reducing transaction costs.
</p>

<p>
  In reality, we see clusters of similar businesses, like a street in New York
  that's all flower shops. Years ago, I went to an electronics market in
  Zhongguancun, where every stall claimed to sell graphic cards. If you showed
  interest, they'd go and buy one from a neighboring stall to sell to you. This
  kind of homogenized business environment can be mutually beneficial. One way
  to think about it is as different departments within a single large-scale
  enterprise.
</p>

<p>
  A hundred shops each selling one type of product and one shop selling a
  hundred types of products can, to a certain extent, be equivalent. It's just a
  matter of collaboration costs. Two very similar pancake stands may also differ
  in services; for example, one owner may be male, and the other female,
  attracting different customers. Over time, they might even specialize in
  different flavors. This kind of division of labor and collaboration could
  evolve from destructive competition to constructive competition, requiring a
  period of adjustment and repeated interactions between the operators and
  customers. Sometimes, given enough time, even low-end industries can gradually
  upgrade and develop more mature and complex business models.
</p>

<p>
  The more patient the authorities are in giving these businesses time to
  evolve, the more likely these businesses will aim for long-term benefits and
  build reputations. Impatient authorities might instead force these businesses
  to seek quick profits or even engage in scams. The stronger a community of
  merchants is in developing collaborative models, the more likely they will
  evolve into more efficient and complex systems.
</p>

<p>
  Geographically, markets can be linear, located along a busy thoroughfare, or
  centralized, like a plaza in front of a temple. Linear markets are efficient
  for passersby, but if stretched too long, they become inefficient for
  shoppers. Centralized markets are more efficient for people who are there to
  compare and buy specific goods. Generally, it's a combination of the two.
</p>

<p>
  This kind of market clustering is common. Shops typically do not compete as
  single entities but as part of a larger community of shops. This community
  competes as a unit against other similar communities, not as individual
  stores. In ancient times, markets and stalls would cluster during religious
  festivals, allowing merchants to follow these dates and serve multiple towns.
  This system was also observed in ancient Pompeii and continues to be observed
  in the cyclic appearance of markets in different towns in North China.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, clusters of shops or goods are far more common than isolated shops
  like the lone "Mrs. Sun's Bun Shop." This collective approach to market
  competition tends to be the norm rather than the exception.
</p>

<p>
  In ancient times, it was common for various shops and stalls to gather during
  markets or temple festivals. People would go to temples to worship on
  religious holidays, and merchants would gather outside the temples to sell
  goods, providing great convenience to worshippers. Each town had its own
  deities with specific worship days, enabling merchants to move from one town
  to another according to these dates.
</p>

<p>
  Archaeological records from Pompeii indicate that markets took place on
  different days in various towns. The same happens in North China, where
  markets periodically appear in different towns based on specific dates.
</p>

<p>
  Another type of market cycle is industry-specific, for example, selling used
  goods on the 5th, livestock on the 8th, and grains on the 10th of the month.
  This leads to higher transaction volumes. Markets can be geometrically
  distributed in two ways: linearly, along a busy thoroughfare, or centralized,
  typically in a square in front of a temple. Linear markets are efficient for
  passersby but become less so when stretched too long. Centralized markets are
  more efficient for those who are there to compare and purchase specific goods.
  In reality, markets often combine both types.
</p>

<p>
  To operate in all weather conditions, markets might have permanent roofs, like
  in Istanbul's bazaars or in Athens, Rome, and Milan's arcaded markets. Whether
  built by city authorities or private entrepreneurs, the builders could charge
  stall fees. These markets often surrounded significant locations, usually
  temple entrances, and were called 'forums'. The term 'forum' originally
  referred to these arcades, which served as marketplaces but also facilitated
  discussions and had political functions.
</p>

<p>
  Generally, markets are based on transient merchants who struggle to establish
  business credit and guarantee product quality. Fixed stalls or shops are
  excellent complements to markets. They have higher operational costs and
  require a stable customer base, appearing much later during the Hellenistic
  period of urban economic development. The shops in ancient Rome were called
  'taberna,' and they appeared on busy city streets. In Pompeii, courtyard
  houses along main roads had rooms used as shops. These shops sold a variety of
  goods, often including eateries, the English word 'tavern' deriving from the
  Roman term 'taberna'. Shops allowed for credit-based transactions and helped
  build a class of credible professional merchants.
</p>

<p>
  In modern times, we have department stores or supermarkets that sell a wide
  range of products and services from hundreds of manufacturers. These stores
  guarantee quality, and while they may not lower prices, they reduce
  transaction costs. This appeals to customers who are less sensitive to price
  changes.
</p>

<p>
  Such department stores or supermarkets have not fully replaced traditional
  market communities, as many price-sensitive customers still prefer them. Large
  malls often combine with smaller shops on adjacent streets to form a larger,
  more efficient system. Different types of stores exhibit different types of
  adaptability, and while small shops frequently change ownership, they seldom
  disappear entirely. Large malls, however, can usually weather economic
  downturns because the cost of brand failure is higher for them. Both
  contribute to the stability and adaptability of a shopping district.
</p>

<p>
  Today, large malls, department stores, and supermarket chains occupy a
  significant market share. They represent superior organizational capabilities
  and credit accumulation. However, small shops and even street vendors, like
  those sometimes encountered selling turtles and car accessories on Beijing
  streets, continue to exist. These entities can emerge and evolve, with various
  businesses shifting between being large and small based on dynamic and
  intermittent equilibriums. Thus, the landscape of commerce is forever
  evolving, with competition focusing on efficiency and adaptability to changing
  environments.
</p>

<p>
  Business organization is a complicated topic covering different types of
  commerce, from street vendors and farmers' markets to single-business shops,
  mixed-business stores, department stores, supermarkets, and commercial
  complexes. Each is a specialized subject that could warrant many academic
  papers and consultancy reports. The competition between them is similar to
  what we see in biological ecosystems, vying for efficiency and adaptability to
  changing environments.
