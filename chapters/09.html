  <strong>Mountains, Seas and Rivers</strong>, <strong>Olds and Youngs</strong>
</p>

<p>
  We often perceive the mountains, rivers, and seas depicted on maps as ancient
  and unchanging, but this is hardly true.
</p>

<p>
  Mountains are generally very old, with some dating back
  <strong>millions of years</strong>, most mountains have maintained a similar
  appearance over time, except for those with active volcanoes. When an active
  volcano erupts, it can deposit thousands of meters of volcanic material on
  flat ground, forming new mountainous structures. These eruptions can result in
  the creation of craters or bays with diameters of tens of kilometers. But
  volcanic eruptions are generally infrequent events, and their magnitude
  declines as the radioactive elements within the Earth become depleted over
  time. Landsliding takes place at only steep slopes and are normally limited in
  scale. In macro scope mountains can be almost seen as static for the span of
  human history.
</p>

<p>
  The sea, influenced by ice ages, experiences fluctuations in sea levels over
  <strong>tens of thousands of years</strong>. As a result, coastlines undergo
  significant changes. For instance, the coast of the Bohai Sea was once located
  at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, submerging a large portion of the North
  China Plain. The Bohai Sea has even completely disappeared at certain points
  in history, leaving behind swamps. Over time, the coastline has receded to the
  periphery of the continental shelf, leading to the integration of the mainland
  and the Japanese archipelago. But it is not easily observed for the span of an
  individual life.
</p>

<p>
  Rivers are far more dynamic and undergo rapid changes. For instance, the Han
  River, which was a major river in ancient times, experienced a diversion due
  to the 186 BC Wudu Earthquake. This diversion caused the upper reaches of the
  Han River to flow southward into the Jialing River. Consequently, today's Han
  River represents only the lower portion of the ancient Han River. Similarly,
  upper Rhine once drained into the Dnaub. The first capital for the State of
  Illinois, Kaskaskia, was on the eastern side of the Mississippi River, as
  Mississippi changed course following the flood in 1881, it is now on the
  western side. This happens <strong>in a person's life</strong> and creates
  many undesirable results.

<p>
  Rivers in plain areas exhibit even faster transformations. I previously
  addressed this topic in my podcast. This chapter delves into the relationship
  between hydrology and cities, offering additional materials and perspectives,
  albeit with some repeated information. In summary, the primary types of
  aquatic landforms can be classified as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Plateaus</strong>, such as Columbia Plateau and the Loess Plateau.
  </li>

  <li>
    Small <strong>valleys</strong> within steep mountains, such as Yosemite and
    Zermatt Valleys.
  </li>

  <li>
    Large river valleys,<strong> floodplains</strong>, deltas, and swamps. This
    category holds particular significance.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Lagoons</strong> formed by sand embankments resulting from seawater
    erosion, such as Venice Lagoon and Currituck Sound in Virginia.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These are expanded below:</p>

<p>
  <strong>The first type is the plateau</strong>. Often ancient plains, plateaus
  were raised by tectonic movements. The elevation is not uniform, and there is
  a large difference in height between the high and low places.
</p>

<p>
  In areas with large elevation differences, where the ground water velocity is
  relatively fast, the cutting effect of river water is dominant. On the high
  terraces, the surface soil will be washed away by the flow of water, and the
  riverbed will be washed deeper and deeper, forming gullies as if cut by knives
  and axes. In the deepest case, like the canyon of the Colorado River in the
  United States, it will be thousands of meters deep. In this process, the
  higher plateaus will be farther away from the river, and the water on the
  higher ground will become more and more scarce. Some originally fertile
  terraces lost irrigation after the river channel sank, and the soil became dry
  and barren.
</p>

<p>
  On the Loess Plateau, the hydrological conditions for agriculture used to be
  better than they are now. It is also the birthplace of the great powers in the
  East Asian continent in the past dynasties, and it is also likely to be the
  earliest settlement of the Chinese civilization. It is believed that both Xia
  and Zhou originated from the Loess Plateau. It gave birth to the most powerful
  state of Jin among the states of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Liu Han during the
  Five Hu period. The predecessor of the Sui and Tang Empires, the Northern Wei
  Dynasty. The predecessor of the Song Dynasty, in the Five Dynasties, there
  were four except the Late Liang.
</p>

<p>
  In Shanxi, there are surprisingly many places that can become ancient
  capitals, such as Anyi, Quwo, Jiangcheng, Pingyang, Jinyang, and Pingcheng.
  From these cities great nations arose.
</p>

<p>
  I also mentioned before that the Angkor civilization is in the plateau area of
  Tonle Sap Lake. It is generally believed that the plateau area lost irrigation
  due to river erosion. Leading to the decline of Angkor.
</p>

<p>
  Plateaus have acted as the cradle for numerous ancient civilizations.
  Presently, many fertile plateaus still exist, such as the Hetao area, the Fen
  River Valley, and the Mexico Basin.
</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>
  <strong>The second landscape</strong> emerges when water flows from the
  plateau into the plain with strong erosive force, creating
  <strong>steep valleys</strong>. Due to the narrowness of these river valleys,
  extensive arable land is scarce, limiting their capacity to support large
  populations and major cities. Nevertheless, these valleys often serve as vital
  commercial passages.
</p>

<p>
  As the river rushes out of the mountains, it enters
  <strong>the third landform - the flood plain</strong>. Notable examples of
  flood plains include the North China Plain, Jianghan Plain, Songnen Plain,
  Liaohe Plain, and Pearl River Delta.
</p>

<p>
  The flood plain can be divided into three sections. The first section just
  lies where the river exits the valley and enters the Great Plains. The terrain
  in this area is normally slightly sloped, making it an ideal location for
  major cities to develop.
</p>

<p>
  In previous discussions, (My Podcast) episode 44 covered Beijing, and episode
  3 mentioned Washington briefly. Episode 2 touched on London and Vienna as
  well. However, there are numerous other cities that fit this description. If
  you observe from north to south along the eastern foot of the Taihang
  Mountain, you will encounter a series of cities along the Beijing-Guangzhou
  Railway.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, there's Yanjing, present-day Beijing, a historically strategic
  location. Shijiazhuang, once known as Zhending, was another strategic site
  contested during the Anshi Rebellion and many other wars. Handan served as the
  capital of the Zhao State, and Linzhang in Hebei was the largest town
  developed by the Wei State. Yecheng served as a capital, and Anyang in Henan
  was the capital of the Yin and Shang Dynasties.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, if you follow the northern or southern foot of the Alps, you will
  come across a series of important cities, such as Vienna, Munich, Zurich,
  Turin, Milan, and Verona. These locations were not chosen by accident.
</p>

<p>
  The Po Valley has displayed a similar setting. Most of the large cities are
  located at the mountain foot. Turino has the highest location, which is in the
  smaller upstream basin. Others are aligned on the north and south edges of the
  flood plain, with a few exceptions: Mantua, on a small mountain in the middle
  of the plain; <strong>Ferrar, Venice and Ravenna</strong>, which are more
  related to the <strong>lagoon </strong>economy. Ferrara's lagoon feature has
  disappeared for the modern landfills.
</p>

  /></a>
</figure>

<p>
  The common features among these places are as follows: 1) Proximity to rivers
  with access to water sources and transportation. 2) Positioned away from
  flood-prone areas downstream. 3) Presence of vast irrigated land, conducive to
  grain production. 4) Strategic locations at the intersection of valley
  commercial routes and foothill avenues, which was discussed in Podcast Episode
  #44. 5) Often featuring hills suitable for castle fortifications and leisure
  activities.
</p>

<p><strong>Upper Sites</strong></p>

<p>
  The large cities at the foot of the mountain can also be divided into two
  categories:
  <strong>the upper section and the lower section of the foothill</strong>.
  Modern large cities at the foot of the mountain are generally in the lower
  section. And older settlements will appear in a higher position upstream of
  today's big cities. You can find city sites from the Warring States Period at
  the Yamen Gate（衙门口） of Shijingshan in the upper reaches of Beijing.
  Mancheng （满城）in the upper reaches of Baoding（保定） is the site of an
  older city in Baoding. The ancient city of Zhongshan is in Pingshan County
  （平山县）upstream of Shijiazhuang. These ancient cities in the upper part of
  the foothills are characterized by more steep terrain, defensive location, and
  rivers flowing by. The valley flats will be relatively small, with arable land
  but not too much. This kind of terrain falls into the criteria of the terrain
  features required to build small reservoirs during the 1959 Great Leap Forward
  Movement in Communist China. By damming the mouths of the valleys, the rivers
  would flood these small high plains. Therefore, where there is a small
  reservoir today in China, the underwater area is likely to be a site of
  archaeological value.
</p>

<p><strong>Down into the Marshes</strong></p>

<p>
  From the foothills road, into the center of the flatter and wider plain,
  whatever the terrain is today, in ancient times it was often represented by
  lakes, swamps or wetlands. Swamps and wetlands are areas of expansion of
  cultivated land. To develop these areas, it is necessary to master the
  techniques of drainage and irrigation.
</p>

<p>
  Started from the mountainous plateau and the heights of the foothills, and
  then began to gradually develop the wetlands on the plains into farmland. is a
  common developmental trajectory.
</p>

<p><strong>Islands in the Wetlands</strong></p>

<p>
  Above the swamp, there are some higher hills or some small mounds exposed,
  like small islands in the sea. There are many such hills in the Yangtze River
  Basin, such as Guishan and Snake Mountain in Wuhan, Huqiu in Suzhou, and
  Jinshan in Zhenjiang.
</p>

<p>
  In the Yellow River Basin, on the flood plain from Taihang Mountain to Mount
  Tai, the place name in ancient times was often called some hill（丘）. For
  example, Chuqiu（楚丘）, Diqiu（帝丘）, Fengqiu（封丘）, Shangqiu（商丘）,
  Taoqiu（陶丘）, and Kuiqiu（葵丘）. According to previous statistics, there
  were 53 place names with 丘 hill in the books, Chunqiu and Zuozhuan. Moreover,
  many of these hills are very important cities in history, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Chuqiu, which is recognized as the hill of ancestral temples by Chu people
    in Puyang, Henan today. It is also the cemetery of the ancient ancestors of
    this tribe.
  </li>

  <li>
    Diqiu is the capital of the legendary Gaoyang Emperor Zhuanxu. In Qu Yuan's
    Lisao, he said that he was a descendant of Emperor Gaoyang. So Chuqiu and
    Diqiu seem to be talking about the same place, or different places that are
    very close to each other. Diqiu is a very important place in ancient
    mythology. But now it is a small village.
  </li>

  <li>
    Taoqiu was the capital of Cao State in Spring and Autumn Period. It is also
    the place where Fan Li, as mentioned in the historical records, made his
    fortune in business under the pseudonym Tao Zhugong after he retired. It has
    been described as a major trade post. Obviously, in the Eastern Zhou
    Dynasty, there was a huge population and well-developed transportation
    around here. The surrounding river and lake network will be much more
    navigable than today, and water transportation was much more important than
    land transportation.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Early Population Explosion</strong></p>

<p>
  Primitive agriculture, when combined with new irrigated land development,
  seemed to provide an endless supply of food. This abundance reflects the
  legendary "Garden of Eden" state, which mirrors the earliest human
  civilization's transition from the hills and smaller plains on the Euphrates
  River's right bank into the heartland of Mesopotamia. This represented a
  period of exponential growth, with resources expanding and population sharply
  increasing.
</p>

<p>
  In archaeology, this stage is referred to as the Obeid period, which likely
  spans from 8,000 to 5,800 years ago. Villages of the Obeid period often lacked
  walls, indicative of a society where food was plentiful, and there seemed to
  be little reason for conflict.
</p>

<p>
  Despite the richness of this period, only a few tales remain, among them the
  myth of a great flood, and the archaeological remains from the Obeid period
  buried under layers of sediment.
</p>

<p>
  The flood plains of ancient times were both bountiful farmlands and death
  traps, traps that were both hydrological and social. Successive waves of
  civilizations, originating from the highlands, fell into these traps. The
  history of East Asia is a collection of stories where various forces attempted
  to develop agriculture on the plains, only to be eventually defeated.
</p>

<p><strong>The Trap</strong></p>

<p>
  The mounds, often cited in the Zuo Zhuan of the Spring and Autumn Period, are
  difficult to locate today. These formations arose in a way similar to sand
  dunes in the desert. Sediment accumulated during floods, resulting in the
  mound protruding above the surrounding swamp, making it suitable for human
  settlement. However, after a few more cycles of flooding, it could be covered
  or flattened.
</p>

<p>
  These mounds in the alluvial plain's core area are transiently beautiful and
  might not feel risky at all within a few generations. They may become popular
  dwelling sites for a time, but in the long run, they are unstable and do not
  develop into lasting large cities.
</p>

<p>What if an ancient nation chose to enter the heart of the flood plain?</p>

<p><strong>The Migration/Colonization Pattern</strong></p>

    （Video above: most Chinese dynasties originated in smaller high valleys in
    the north west and gradually moving their centers to the grain aboundant
    plains in the southeast. This patterns repeats itself many times, with is
    not different from a similar pattern in the Indian Subcontinent.)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The Warring States period of ancient China provides an apt historical context
  for the discussion. During this time, the State of Wei migrated from the
  rugged terrains of present-day Anyi in Shanxi Province to the Liang region
  around Kaifeng. "King Hui of Liang", one of the main characters in Mencius,
  refers to the title adopted by the king of Wei post-relocation.
</p>

<p>
  Originating as a feudal duchy, Wei bore resemblance to the European feudal
  states where ordinary citizens were under the stewardship of nobles and
  dignitaries rather than being direct subjects of the Holy Roman Emperor.
  Traditionally, the citizens of Wei were under the command of the nobles and
  not directly under the king of Wei. However, upon relocating to the grand city
  of Daliang, the vast land surrounding it came under the direct jurisdiction of
  the king of Wei.
</p>

<p>
  Another tale involves Ximen Bao's governance of Yecheng. Usually, the lands of
  Wei were managed by the nobles. However, Ximen Bao was not a noble of Wei, and
  Yecheng was not his fiefdom. He was a hydrology expert and a bureaucrat,
  personally appointed by the king of Wei, akin to the governor of Lima
  appointed by the king of Spain. He was in charge of managing the king's
  finances.
</p>

<p>
  By occupying the regions of Liang and Yecheng, the king of Wei amassed wealth
  surpassing that of all traditional nobles in Wei. He could then recruit
  warriors and migrants from all over, establishing one of the strongest
  absolutist states in the early Warring States period, initially experiencing a
  period of immense prosperity.
</p>

<p>
  The process was similar to the migration of the State of Zhao from Jinyang in
  Shanxi to Handan in Hebei.
</p>

<p>
  Yecheng and Liang, later known as Bianliang or Kaifeng, possessed expansive
  irrigable land and a convenient waterway network. They attracted numerous
  regimes from the western and northern regions beyond the Taihang Mountains. In
  addition to Wei, Yecheng hosted later regimes like Zhao, Ran Wei, Qian Yan,
  Eastern Wei, and Northern Qi, which all originated from the lands of Jin and
  Yan.
</p>

<p>
  After the construction of the canal in the Sui Dynasty, Bianliang became the
  most critical city in the North China Plain. The Bianhe River's water
  transportation could reach the Huaihe River directly, and then through the
  canal, it could reach Yangzhou and Suzhou, the most prosperous grain-producing
  areas. For hundreds of years after the Tang Dynasty, it was the principal city
  in Kanto and the most crucial military governor (Jiedushi). The regimes of the
  Five Dynasties, the Later Han, Later Zhou, and Northern Song, all originated
  from Jinyang and sought development and established their capital in
  Bianliang.
</p>

<p>
  Other examples include the ancient kings of Upper Egypt establishing their
  capital at Memphis in Lower Egypt or Turkic Islamic pioneers developing the
  Bengal region.
</p>

<p>
  However, the hydrology of alluvial plains is incredibly unstable. As
  previously mentioned, the six cities under the ground of Kaifeng were
  periodically inundated and buried under layers of silt. The foundation of the
  lowest city of Kaifeng is buried several meters below today's city surface.
  Every flood left several meters of silt behind.
</p>

<p>
  Between the Yellow River and the Hai River, and between the Bian River and the
  Si River, no river has a fixed course. Bian River's navigation was easily
  blocked by silt. In the Yuan Dynasty, a new canal, closer to Dadu, was built
  from Jining and Dezhou, bypassing Bianliang and causing a drastic drop in
  Bianliang's economic status. This is a characteristic of delta cities:
  population increases are rapid, but disasters are also dramatic, leading to
  abrupt rises and falls. This is a common trait among the four major river
  civilizations of ancient times.
</p>

<p>
  Some cities, such as New York, Venice, Constantinople, Hong Kong, etc., which
  have less direct adjacency to flood plains and more to do with maritime
  activities, are not discussed above.
</p>

<p><strong>Three Types</strong></p>

<p>
  To summarize, from a hydrological perspective, there are generally three types
  of locations chosen for major cities:
</p>

<p>
  1) Cities on high ground often have ancient cities, but high ground often
  encounters the problem of soil degradation.
</p>

<p>
  2) Cities on the foothills of mountains, where the hydrological environment is
  most stable.
</p>

<p>
  3) Cities at the heart of alluvial plains, which, in ancient times, had
  astonishing population explosions and prosperity. However, they often
  encountered disasters due to floods and changes in river courses, typically
  based on a small hill or mound.
</p>

<p>
  Among these three types, the second type is most likely to develop into major
  cities that transcend eras.
</p>
