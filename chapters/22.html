<h1>22 Suburbanization - Second Half - Automobile Driven Sprawl (1)</h1>

<p>
  Around World War II, the proliferation of automobiles intensified the process
  of suburbanization, becoming one of the most significant topics in
  contemporary urban planning. This subject has generated countless doctoral
  theses and remains an ever-evolving field of study.
</p>

<p>I will outline the discussion as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The unprecedented power of automobiles as a mode of transportation greatly
    enhanced the mobility of both people and goods. Unlike the earlier emergence
    of railway systems, automobiles possessed a unique characteristic -
    unparalleled freedom and the ability to reach virtually all corners of a
    city. Consequently, they offered higher efficiency and had a more profound
    impact. As a result, automobiles fundamentally altered the dynamic
    characteristics of cities. If we were to draw an analogy with the animal
    kingdom, it would be akin to a species having its blood oxygen concentration
    increased tenfold and its blood flow speed accelerated tenfold, leading to
    its evolution into an entirely new species. Such a leap in capability allows
    it to enter uncharted resource territory, resulting in significant resource
    redundancy, enabling it to engage in actions that may go against short-term
    interests without punishment. It can accommodate many inefficient and
    alternative strategies that would be unsustainable in normal circumstances.
    This is analogous to the human species, which can accommodate various types,
    including the lazy, homebodies, mad scientists, and thinkers. It has room
    for those with mental and physical disabilities, exhibiting significant
    tolerance for diverse lifestyles. In contrast, the lifestyle options for our
    closest relatives, such as gorillas, are far more limited. Therefore,
    suburbanization driven by automobiles is a realm vastly different from
    traditional urbanization.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    The enormous resource consumption associated with suburbanization by
    automobiles is extremely costly. Initially, this model was confined to the
    United States and a few developed countries, considered an unsustainable
    development pattern. However, this pattern is now spreading to more
    economies, including China and India, both developing major nations.
    Consequently, it poses challenges to these countries and the global economy
    and ecological environment.
  </li>

  <li>
    The proliferation of automobiles can alter the form of business districts,
    siphoning vitality away from city centers. This phenomenon is currently
    unfolding in China, and many are still adjusting to it.
  </li>

  <li>
    Although automobile-induced suburbanization has been criticized by
    mainstream Western academia, the underlying trend may not necessarily
    diminish. In a world characterized by peace and progress, suburbanization
    might even deepen in the future through technological advancements and
    become increasingly refined. Conversely, if we are facing a turbulent and
    declining world, the vulnerability of automobile-driven suburbs may become
    exposed, potentially leading to the collapse of urban economic ecosystems.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let's delve further into this discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Automobile's Early Proliferation in the United States</strong></p>

<p>
  The automobile first gained widespread popularity in the United States,
  primarily because of the country's wealth and early production of relatively
  affordable cars. In 1924, Ford manufactured two million Model-T cars, each
  selling for $260, equivalent to about two months' wages for American
  white-collar workers at the time. Consequently, suburbanization began in the
  United States earliest and reached its peak intensity there.
</p>

<p><strong>Changing Urban Dynamics with the Automobile</strong></p>

<p>
  Before the advent of cars, cities were measured by foot. However, with the
  arrival and widespread use of automobiles, spatial distance became less
  relevant. What does this mean? It means that with automobiles, one could
  effectively participate in urban economic activities even if they were 30
  kilometers away from the city center. The developable urban space expanded
  significantly, covering thousands of square kilometers. This resulted in a
  surplus of spatial resources. Building density typically remained below 0.3
  and often fell below 0.1. This shift allowed for the development of new,
  batch-built suburbs where houses looked different but were essentially the
  same. They were often spaced far apart, leading to a self-centered appearance.
  Not only residential areas but also office buildings and super shopping
  centers followed this pattern. The granularity of various construction
  activities became coarser.
</p>

<p>
  Our common perception is that European traditional city centers are very
  refined, while American suburbs appear monotonous. However, this difference is
  largely a matter of scale. The United States also has finely crafted
  traditional city centers, although they tend to be smaller. Conversely,
  European cities, despite their larger, well-preserved historical centers,
  often have peripheral areas connected by highways that can resemble American
  suburbs. (I'd like to interject that the phenomenon of rough urban
  construction is not solely caused by cars but is also related to the rise of
  the global working class and the decline of feudal organizations in the 20th
  century.)
</p>

<p><strong>Automobile Suburbanization around the World</strong></p>

<p>
  Around the world, the automobile made cities more rugged and straightforward.
  Designing roads for motor traffic engineering became more critical than city
  design and landscaping skills. However, this does not imply that the world
  regressed. Quite the opposite, the tremendous leap in capabilities brought
  about by cars created a surplus of resources. This led to a phase of
  development imbalance.
</p>

<p>
  To illustrate, think back to when you were in high school, and you received
  $100 in pocket money each month. You carefully spent every cent and found joy
  in it. Suddenly, one day, your mother won the lottery, and your monthly
  allowance became $10,000. Initially, like many overnight millionaires, you
  might spend extravagantly and irresponsibly. However, it doesn't mean your
  standard of living decreased. You would gradually learn to manage your
  expenses and become more sophisticated.
</p>

<p>
  Suburbanization driven by automobiles is currently in a rough and rudimentary
  stage. In the future, it's highly likely to evolve into a more sophisticated
  form.
</p>

<p>
  However, this period of ruggedness will likely last a long time, and its
  impact will be profound. My earlier discussion is primarily based on developed
  countries. Nevertheless, societies with fewer resource surpluses have also
  been influenced by the car-centric model of Western countries. This influence
  has penetrated deeply into their consciousness and led to some distortions in
  their development processes.
</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Challenges Posed by the Car-Centric Suburban Model</strong></p>

<p>
  Let me explain some of the challenges brought to the world by the car-centric
  suburban model.
</p>

<p>
  Firstly, let's consider that cars, in an absolute sense, are quite expensive.
  Taking data from the United States in 2017 as an example, the nation spent
  about $1.1 trillion on cars, which equates to an average of over $3,600 per
  person. This is roughly equivalent to the per capita GDP of Mongolia.This
  expenditure includes the cost of purchasing cars, maintenance, insurance,
  parking fees, fuel, and more. Interestingly, the cost of fuel was only around
  $290 billion, which is less than one-third of the total expenditure.In
  contrast, Americans spent only about $53 billion on all public transportation
  combined, excluding air travel.So, you can see the ratio here. The consumption
  related to private cars compared to public transportation is roughly 7:1.
</p>

<p>
  In the United States, 26% of energy consumption occurs in the transportation
  sector. Furthermore, 40% of energy consumption is attributed to buildings.
  It's worth noting that a significant portion of this energy use comes from
  low-density buildings associated with the car-centric suburban model. Compared
  to traditional urban buildings, low-density structures have higher surface
  area heat loss and consume more energy in transporting utilities. (For
  instance, two single-story houses with 100 square meters each have a larger
  total roof area than a two-story house with 100 square meters on each floor.
  This results in higher energy consumption for heating and cooling, as well as
  increased demands on municipal utilities.)
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, one might assert that if we were to compress all the existing
  low-density suburbs into a traditional urban format, we could potentially save
  roughly one-third of the energy consumed in transportation and construction,
  which amounts to about 66% of the total energy consumption.
</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Land Consumption</strong></p>

<p>In terms of land consumption:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Road Area</strong>: The area occupied by a car while on the road
    depends on its speed and the following distance, typically ranging from 2 to
    4 seconds of travel distance. In slow-moving areas like city centers,
    following distances can be as short as 20 meters, while in moderate-speed
    situations, it can be around 50 meters. The width of a lane is typically 3-4
    meters. Consequently, the space occupied by each car on the road ranges from
    70 to 200 square meters. During peak hours, a significant proportion of
    vehicles are on the road simultaneously.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Parking Space Area</strong>: Each household typically has one
    parking space, offices have dedicated parking spaces, and commercial areas
    also allocate parking. This means that the parking space required for each
    car is equivalent to several parking spots, approximately 60 square meters.
    When considering both road and parking space, the land area occupied by each
    car is conservatively estimated to be over 100 square meters. Thus, land
    consumption related to cars is comparable to residential land use.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Urban Form</strong></p>

<p>
  Car-centric suburbs initially featured a very uniform spread of detached
  houses, much like those seen in American TV shows such as "The Wonder Years,"
  "Desperate Housewives," or "Six Feet Under." These endless rows of houses
  could be found in places like New Jersey, Long Island, Northern Virginia,
  Maryland, and Southern California. This pattern could be considered the spread
  of the American dream's lifestyle. Of course, this pattern was not entirely
  without order. Typically, there were about 5 houses per acre, with each house
  having a floor area of just over 200 square meters. In areas closer to the
  city center, it might be slightly denser, approaching about 10 houses per
  acre, each with less than 200 square meters. In more remote areas, it could be
  very spacious, with only 1-2 houses per acre, each ranging from 400 to 500
  square meters. However, the differences were not more than an order of
  magnitude; they were quite similar.
</p>

<p>
  This uniformity, from the perspective of information theory, does not
  represent a higher level of order but rather a very low-level order, only
  slightly better than chaos. It represents the initial deployment of this
  pattern.
</p>

<p>
  In terms of transportation structure, car-centric suburbs often had some roads
  that didn't connect to others, what's known as cul-de-sacs or dead ends. More
  commonly, there were ambiguous roads that seemed to be passable but often
  weren't. These are referred to as "connected but not efficient" roads. The
  road network in these areas is sometimes described as resembling spaghetti - a
  tangled mess of roads where you can't easily determine how many strands there
  are or which one leads where.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, your house is typically situated on a road that leads only to
  your residential area. Unless someone intends to enter your neighborhood or
  has taken a wrong turn, they will never pass by your house. It's rare to see
  strangers in front of your house.
</p>

<p>Some might argue, "Isn't this normal? Isn't this a good thing?"</p>

<p>
  It can be good, especially when viewed from a specific perspective and in
  particular circumstances. If you live in a stable middle-class world, there
  may not be much of a problem.
</p>

<p>
  This raises the fundamental characteristic of car-centric suburbs: high cost.
</p>

<p>
  I have firsthand experience of living in such communities. In these
  neighborhoods, you can barely walk to even a convenience store. To buy
  anything or meet anyone, you need a car. So, owning a car is essential. People
  without driver's licenses, like children, have incomplete human rights.
  Therefore, the barrier to entry in such communities is owning a car, as I
  mentioned earlier, costing around $300 per month. This is enough to exclude
  the poorest classes.
</p>

<p>
  Hence, car-centric suburbs form a series of middle-class enclaves that achieve
  class segregation. The homogeneity of these communities precisely reflects the
  middle class's desire to live among their class peers.
</p>

<p>
  Even beggars would not venture into these suburbs because the population is
  too sparse to extract any substantial resources from.
</p>

<p>
  So, those on the political left (referred to as "white left" here) who live in
  the suburbs might be seen as hypocritical or ill-suited. If you have the
  capability, you could choose to be neighbors with unmarried, teenage African
  American mothers and their children in the inner city after all.
</p>

<p><strong>Social Structure</strong></p>

<p>
  This suburbanization has altered urban and social structures significantly.
  Prior to the 19th century, people lived in traditional city centers. Your
  neighbors were often your baker, your tailor who made your clothes, the
  carpenter who repaired your house, your child's teacher, and perhaps, your
  neighbor was your teacher, landlord, or someone you attended church with. Each
  person's home often served multiple purposes. The ground floor might be your
  shop, you lived on the second floor, and the attic might house your tenants,
  often young individuals or apprentices.
</p>

<p>
  In contrast to traditional city centers, car-centric suburbs have created
  relatively homogenous communities. Perhaps dozens of adjacent houses are
  purely residential, devoid of shops or industrial facilities. These houses
  don't necessarily serve as destinations for one another. You may share your
  faith with some of your neighbors or be the parents of your children's
  schoolmates, but forming a close-knit community with direct commercial or
  extensive social interactions becomes challenging. In theory, you could live
  next to your neighbors without ever visiting their homes or getting to know
  them.
</p>

<p>
  These suburbs have contributed to the formation of modern nuclear families. I
  use the term "nuclear families" rather than "atomized individuals."
</p>

<p>
  The organic nature of society has undergone changes, if not necessarily
  declines. People enter industry sectors when they go to work and residential
  sectors when they return home. These two sectors have become disconnected.
  Consequently, compared to traditional society, people's dependence on these
  two sectors has decreased. This has led to greater fluidity and a pursuit of
  universality in individual lives.
</p>

<p>
  In the next segment, I will discuss the unique characteristics of
  suburbanization in China and some features of suburban commercial districts.
