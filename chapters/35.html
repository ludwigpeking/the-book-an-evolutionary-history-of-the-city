<h1>35 Skyline as an Evolutionary Phenomenon</h1>

<p>
  The skyline of a city is an important part of a city's image and is therefore
  valued. In this chapter we discuss Skyline. It is first a natural phenomenon,
  then a phenomenon of urban evolution, and in modern times, it has sometimes
  become an object of design. Let me expand on the explanation below.
</p>

<p>
  What is a Skyline? The skyline is that dividing line between sky and earth at
  the end of the line of sight. If you are blocked by something very close and
  tall in front of you, you won't be able to see the skyline. Therefore, it is
  often several kilometers or tens of kilometers of empty space in between
  allowing one to see the typical skyline. All that drive to the downtown of
  Chicago, New York or Lujiazui from afar for the first time are well impressed
  by their skylines .
</p>

<p>
  The skyline of a city is valued by people because it can reveal a lot of
  information about the city. The power of a thing is often related to its
  volume. Tall things on the skyline are likely to reflect where the power is.
</p>

<p>
  In history, the skyline, in many cases, for the longest time, was actually
  dominated by natural objects such as mountains and trees. Even today, natural
  objects still stand out on the skylines of some cities. The cities of Tokyo
  and Yokohama area, you can see Mount Fuji on a clear day. In downtown
  Portland, you can clearly see Mount Hood. In downtown Seattle, you can see
  Mount Rainier; in downtown Vancouver, you can see Mount Baker. Kagoshima City
  directly faces Sakurajima Volcano. These huge peaks protruding from the clouds
  can easily arouse residents' awe of nature and thinking about the way of
  heaven and earth.
</p>

<p>Of course, the skyline we see today is more shaped by man-made buildings.</p>

<p>
  The layers of these artificial skylines have always been political and
  sensitive.
</p>

<p>
  In rural China today, people are very concerned about whether other people's
  houses are taller than their own. When many people build a house, they will
  sneak over the roof of the neighbor next door. This is both explicit
  comparison and social witchcraft.
</p>

<p>
  The so-called comparison can be regarded as a kind of political science. The
  height of the roof may indicate the status of his family in the community; a
  high roof may increase or decrease the social capital of his family; This
  means that it is easier for his family to gain the trust of others when doing
  business and marrying their daughters.
</p>

<p>
  The so-called social witchcraft means that if my house is lower than yours,
  then a series of bad things may happen to me. In order to avoid these
  misfortunes, I must be a little taller than you to be at ease.
</p>

<p>
  Today's rural China can be said to be a very flat society. In traditional
  society, identity is more important. If the height of the houses of ordinary
  members exceeds the height of the houses of community leaders, chiefs, and
  priests, it is a violation of the rules. is unimaginable.
</p>

<p>
  Some prominent vassals in the Warring States Period in Japan were honored as
  oyakata sama—宫屋形式; obviously, in Japanese society, the shape and height of
  your roof should be able to reflect your social rank.
</p>

<p>
  In traditional villages, generally speaking, the skyline composed of houses is
  not high, not even as eye-catching as the forest tops, presenting a relatively
  soft and subtle level.
</p>

<p>
  The prominent elements on the skyline are generally built on the hills and
  high points of the terrain in the urban area. That is to say, the Acropolis, a
  city within a city floating above the plain towns. It is often a complex of
  fortresses, temples, treasuries, granaries, and in the Middle Ages, often the
  castles of lords or monasteries. This type is known for its dominant
  expression in such large cities as Athens, Monaco, Edinburgh, Budapest,
  Salzburg, and Osaka.
</p>

<p>
  Japanese princes, such as Oda Nobunaga's Gifu Castle and Azuchi Castle, built
  castle towers on the top of the mountain, no different from Salzburg and
  Edinburgh. This setting is not regional, but universal across cultures.
</p>

<p>
  Living on the hills, on the one hand, is conducive to defense and can reduce
  risks; on the other hand, the transportation and transportation costs up and
  down the mountains are very high, and sometimes it is not easy to drink water
  and dig wells. If you are an agricultural or industrial or commercial person,
  you need to go in and out of roads or farmland frequently, and the cost of
  living in the mountains is too high. Therefore, it is the princes, princesses,
  temple elders and the like who are qualified to live in the hilltop castles as
  feudal lords and their subordinates. Living on top of a mountain is a
  privilege.
</p>

<p>
  In flat cities, in some cases, walls, gates and watchtowers, these
  fortifications can form the most striking elements of the skyline.
</p>

<p>
  The city wall, as the outer skin of the city, is a very suitable place for
  image engineering. A dilapidated city wall will appear weak. The tall city
  walls are enough to show the financial strength and military equipment of a
  city. Therefore, ancient cities with city walls as the main element of the
  skyline are very common.
</p>

<p>
  It is a civilized phenomenon. The scheming ruler modified the city walls and
  towers far beyond the needs of the city defense itself. For example, in the
  ancient cities of Mesopotamia, Nineveh and Babylon, some disproportionately
  high towers were built, and the walls and gates decorated with extremely
  gorgeous glazed bricks can still be seen today. Their magnificence Beyond the
  needs of the walls themselves. The towers on the city wall have even become
  places for mysterious activities such as stargazing and performing rituals.
  Use these activities to express Wenzhiwugong to foreigners as well as to the
  ruled in the country. These are all hardware used to educate people and guide
  order.
</p>

<p>
  Building tall and solid masonry buildings can permanently dominate the skyline
  and establish an order for generations to come. The Egyptian pyramid has stood
  for more than 4,600 years. Its owner and that civilization have passed away,
  but you have to say that even if it has not moved, it has at least shocked and
  inspired hundreds of generations of people, and it is still glorifying that
  land today. Similar buildings that permanently dominate the skyline can be
  seen in Mesopotamia, in the Wei River valley, in India, Sri Lanka or Mexico.
</p>

<p>
  The trick of this kind of structure is to present a clear geometric shape. If
  it is not a pyramid, like many huge Buddhist pagodas in South Asia, it also
  needs to be hemispherical, or like the mausoleums of the Kofun era in Japan,
  the front is round and the back is round. Only in this way can it form an
  absolute contrast with the hills in nature. Not to be confused with natural
  objects.
</p>

<p>
  Compared with these monumental buildings as big as mountains. The slender
  tower is a more mainstream monumental building that deliberately protrudes
  from the skyline. Such towers existed in the 9,000-year-old ancient city
  unearthed in Jordan. It is believed that it was used to call farmers to work.
  The towers of medieval churches and the bell and drum towers of Asia all
  strike the hour to tell the residents the time.
</p>

<p>
  The temples at all levels in traditional Islamic cities are equipped with
  towers and minarets. They often stand around the temples and call community
  residents in all directions to worship five times a day.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, the tower is an object serving order, and the order it provides is
  initially very specific.
</p>

<p>
  After the 12th century, in Europe, particularly tall churches appeared. The
  spire of Notre Dame de Paris is 91 meters high. The spire of Cologne Cathedral
  is 157 meters high. There are a large number of main churches in the height
  between the two. These ultra-high towers are beyond the scope of practicality.
</p>

<p>
  Before elevators, the vast majority of houses in cities were no more than 20
  meters high; in those days, of course, these cathedrals stood out and
  dominated the city skyline.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the main church, there are several community churches in a
  city. Sir Lane presided over the design of more than fifty churches in London.
  This includes St Paul's Cathedral, the main church in the East End, while most
  of the rest are community churches. The top of St. Paul's Cathedral is 110
  meters high, while the spiers of dozens of other community churches are
  generally between 30 and 70 meters high. Cooperating with many residential
  buildings with a height of more than ten meters as the background, they
  together form a typical European traditional city skyline. This skyline is an
  orderly expression of organization at both the city and community levels. A
  city's cathedral, apart from its original intention of glorifying God, also
  reflects the city's wealth, political reputation and artistic level. Like the
  church in every community, it also represented the wealth and prestige of that
  community, behind it were some guilds and bourgeois families. All people hope
  that the splendor of their communities and city churches will match their
  wealth and prestige, and even boast of it.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, the skyline of a traditional city is a system of multi-level
  competition. There is no unified arrangement, but it can quite accurately
  express the strength and ambition of civic associations.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to religious groups building these skyline-altering landmarks,
  secular regimes also build tall landmark buildings.
</p>

<p>
  Siena, a famous medieval city in Tuscany, is located on the top of a hill, and
  the main church is on the top of the highest hill. This position was already
  occupied by a church as early as the 9th century. The bell tower built in the
  12th century is about 70 meters high. The Republic of Siena was established in
  the 12th century, 400 years later than the church, and did not occupy the top
  of the mountain. By the 14th century, the city hall was built on the
  mountainside. Its ground altitude was 30 meters lower than that of the main
  church. In order to express the idea of equality of political power and
  religious power, its bell tower had to be built even higher, reaching 102
  meters. meters so that its top is exactly level with the towers of the
  cathedral, and they form the two high points on the Siena skyline. It also
  became the second tallest secular building in the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
  The height of this tower, on the one hand, does not overstep the authority of
  the church; on the other hand, it surpasses other towers in the city. Siena at
  that time had many more towers than it does now, not only in Siena, but also
  in Bologna, San Gimignano, and Lucca. There were many towers in the city, and
  these towers belonged to rich families. These towers are a special expression
  of the townhouse. We know that British landowners, apart from the manor in
  their hometown, often buy a townhouse in London at the same time.
</p>

<p>
  Local tyrants in Italy are not different. Local tyrants generally own large
  farms in the countryside, and their main income comes from these farms. But at
  the same time, they also have a house in the city. The house in the city is
  relatively compact, which fits the concept of a townhouse. The city is the
  place where local tyrants participate in business activities and political
  activities. At that time, the state apparatus was weak, lacking the police and
  a comprehensive judicial system. Similar to Jin Yong's martial arts, a local
  tyrant needs to take care of his own safety. If a local tyrant is killed by
  another local tyrant, he can only rely on his own descendants to avenge. In
  the long intergenerational development of each local tyrant family, they have
  accumulated their own allies and enemies, and there are continuous
  low-intensity wars. Therefore, the expression form of their townhouse is very
  different from that of London, which is reflected in the form of a fortress
  tower. It protects the dignitaries of one's own family, stores gold and
  silver, and sometimes imprisons enemies. These towers generally range in
  height from twenty to thirty meters to eighty or ninety meters. After a
  certain height, the military benefits of this kind of tower are not great, but
  as long as the etiquette is not lost, every family hopes to be as high as
  possible, as a means of expressing their wealth and prestige. In other words,
  each family is designing its own presentation of the tower on the city
  skyline. In addition, the distribution of these towers is not random and
  loose. They are basically on the main roadside of the city, in locations with
  higher value and a higher sense of presence in the city. They are not
  dissimilar to the considerations in the location and design of the towers that
  President Trump gave him.
</p>

<p>
  We can see that in the pre-industrial era, there were towers of these local
  tyrants, and they competed with church and government buildings on the skyline
  of some cities. However, at that time, the skylines of most cities in the
  world were dominated by It consists of monuments such as city walls, towers,
  church bell towers, and government buildings.
</p>

<p>
  However, after entering the industrial age, private commercial organizations
  and profit-making organizations have inherited the role of ancient local
  tyrants, and they have indeed overwhelmed churches and governments in many
  places, becoming the main builders of high-rise buildings, and indeed changing
  the city's skyline , subverting the original order.
</p>

<p>
  The construction activities of these commercial high-rise buildings are not
  restricted, or are subject to few restrictions, and have been relatively
  freely expressed in some cities in the world. In emerging commercial cities,
  such as New York and Hong Kong; in traditional commercial cities, such as
  Frankfurt, such as parts of London. In these cities, what we see are mainly
  high-rise buildings built and occupied by commercial institutions.
</p>

<p>
  The early meeting place of the U.S. Congress was at No. 26 Wall Street in
  Lower Manhattan, New York. Now, there is a building more than 20 meters high,
  with a majestic facade like the Parthenon, and a dome like the Roman Pantheon
  inside. It is currently a memorial to the old Federal Parliament. It was
  rebuilt on the original site in 1842. At that time, it was obviously a
  relatively tall and eye-catching building. However, today, it is surrounded by
  skyscrapers of many financial institutions, next to it is only a two or three
  meter wide construction joint, the 283-meter-high Manhattan Trust Bank
  Building. In contrast, it looks like a bungalow like a vegetable market.
  Tourists to Wall Street hardly notice it. This approach is equivalent to
  pasting the Shanghai Center on the site of a large conference. So what New
  York embodies is the so-called "barbaric expansion" of capital. Hong Kong is
  similar. The buildings of the Hong Kong British government are in a state of
  being invisible to the naked eye in the shadow of various skyscrapers in
  Central.
</p>

<p>
  The government authorities in New York have also tried to change the skyline
  to highlight public power. That is the Manhattan Municipal Building, which
  started construction in 1909. It has 34 floors, the main body is 106 meters
  high, and the top of the tower is 170 meters high. It was one of the tallest
  buildings in Manhattan at the time. However, within thirty years, the building
  was overwhelmed by the taller buildings in lower Manhattan, only realizing a
  looming existence.
</p>

<p>
  The Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City also strives to be tall and solemn, but it
  is also wrapped by adjacent commercial buildings, and its height is also
  surpassed by them.
</p>

<p>
  The American-style CBD embodies the state of the city's skyline under a
  laissez-faire economic policy environment and a relatively free urban public
  policy environment.
</p>

<p>
  But if the CBD of high-rise buildings will appear if laissez-faire, it would
  be too beautiful. One kilometer away from the center of Salt Lake City, it is
  difficult to find tall buildings on the city skyline, leaving only endless
  single-family houses. Queens and Manhattan are only separated by a river, but
  there are only so many high-rise buildings. Most of them are medium-density
  blocks with several or more than ten floors. The Tokyo metropolitan area has a
  large scale and high density. The high-rise buildings produced are only a few
  small pieces such as Marunouchi, Shinjuku West Exit, and Shiodome. A
  dozen-storey apartment buildings and some commercial streets.
</p>

<p>
  That is to say, under the environment of laissez-faire economic policies, the
  resulting buildings are still 60% low-rise buildings, 30% medium-height
  buildings, and less than 10% high-rise buildings. Moreover, high-rise
  buildings will be very concentrated . Such a pattern. There are differences in
  different regions, but it roughly conforms to such a distribution.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, the order under the laissez-faire economic policy is clearer and more
  resolute than the order of despotism. That is the value of land, including
  commercial value and residential value, which will directly determine the type
  of building on this land.
</p>

<p>
  The so-called barbaric growth of the city skyline. It does not mean that there
  is no order, but that the order is not as good as some people wish.
</p>

<p>
  When technological innovation has just started, such as railways or elevators,
  steel structures, they just appeared as a new thing.
</p>

<p>
  The parameters of the wave function of urban land values change drastically.
  But people's cognitive ability has not kept up with it. People will only see
  the wave function collapsed at some scattered points and leave footprints.
  Since the 1900s, in New York, the Life Insurance Building, the Empire State
  Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Rockefeller Center, One in the east
  and the other in the west, it seems to be disorganized; but 100 years later,
  in New York, two large high-rise buildings in the Midtown and the financial
  district have been clearly formed, and the skyline is quite clear. Moreover,
  this collapse is still in progress. Every 10 years, there will be several
  super high-rise buildings over 300 meters in New York. All of them are
  revealing the order of the global commercial society, and their emergence also
  affects the order.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the public doesn’t always like such skylines, and so do public
  authorities sometimes. In the contemporary era, the conflict between the
  spontaneous order of the market and public perceptions and cultural customs is
  also manifested in the development and changes of the skyline, manifested in
  the attitude towards skyline management. I'll have a chance to discuss that
  later.
