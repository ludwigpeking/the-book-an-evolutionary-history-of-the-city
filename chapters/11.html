<p>I aim to guide you through an examination of specific structures.</p>

<p><strong>Bridges </strong></p>

<p>
  Starting with the simpler and clearer structures, bridges and city gates are
  first on our list.
</p>

<p>
  The economic elements we observe on the earth surface—people, land, various
  products, and services—are separated by multiple obstacles. These obstructions
  could be mountains, rivers, walls, and sometimes railways or highways. They
  partition the land into areas that are internally connected but externally
  disjointed. Topologically, these can be seen as a collection of islands, large
  or small.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, these "islands" have mutual exchanges. The driving force that forms
  a robust connection between them manifests as significant potential energy.
</p>

<p>
  Typically, only a few limited connections exist between these islands.
  Topologically, these points of contact are like bridges. It is at these
  bridge-like points where potential energy is released, creating powerful
  flows.
</p>

<p>
  Historically, bridges were resource-intensive to construct and maintain,
  making them scarce. As construction techniques evolved and became more
  efficient, the creation of bridges became less costly, leading to an increased
  number of bridges between some islands. Thus, the potential energy harnessed
  by old bridges and contemporary ones differs substantially.
</p>

<p>
  In a traditional city sector with an ancient bridge, the road spanning that
  bridge invariably assumes prominence. Such roads, especially near the bridge's
  end, likely form the city's commercial heart.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, the Wanguo Bridge over Tianjin's Haihe River, now known as
  Jiefang Bridge, once encompassed the primary banking street in Tianjin's
  French Concession. Similarly, the road spanning Beijing's Yinding Bridge in
  Houhai, named Yandai Xiejie, represents a traditional commercial street.
</p>

<p>
  Venice's Grand Canal once had only the Rialto bridge, and its vicinity became
  Venice's marketplace. The street it gave passage to emerged as Venice's
  primary commercial avenue. Cities like Tokyo and Osaka have numerous
  commercial districts bearing bridge-related names, such as Shimbashi,
  Nihonbashi, and Shinsaibashi, emphasizing their significance.
</p>

<p>
  But it's not always about river bridges. Overpasses spanning railways can also
  be of great importance. Take Beijing's Wudaokou, a road crossing the railway
  through Chengfu Road. Locals from northwest Beijing humorously dub this the
  "center of the universe." In Shenyang, Nanwuma Road, intersecting the
  Shenyang-Dalian Railway, stands out as the core business district in Tiexi
  District. Many of Tokyo's business zones are situated where streets cross
  railways, with places like Omotesando, spanning the Yamanote Line railway
  tracks, resulting in the Harajuku commercial district.
</p>

<p>
  The intersection of Camden High Street in London's northern suburbs with both
  a canal and a railway creates a bustling commercial area. Washington's H
  Street, spanning above Union Station, has undergone significant
  transformations over the years, consistently revealing new developments.
</p>

<p><strong> City Gate</strong>s</p>

<p>
  City gates are a common feature in traditional cities and, much like
  bridgeheads, they are areas of high traffic potential. Streets that lead
  through these city gates often become busy commercial hubs. In the 74th
  episode of my podcast, "Border-Human Dam", I pointed out the similarities
  between city gates and bridges. There's often a difference between the inside
  and outside of these gates, in terms of ownership, society, and legal
  standards.
</p>

<p>
  Outside the city gate, governance is often more relaxed, fostering a diverse
  mix of people. This environment can quickly lead to the rise of a commercial
  center, forming what's known in some cultures as a 'Guanxiang community' but
  could be referred to as an "extramural district" in English. This isn't unique
  to East Asia.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, during the Roman Empire, both Vienna and London exhibited a
  clear distinction between the inside and outside of their city walls. Inside
  was primarily occupied by Roman troops, settlers, and rulers. Meanwhile,
  outside the walls was a hub of commerce, teeming with local residents and
  traders from across the empire. These extramural districts often sprawled
  along main roads, sometimes even overshadowing the city itself in size and
  activity.
</p>

<p><strong>Ford and London</strong> <strong>Bridge</strong></p>

<p>Let's delve into the history of London.</p>

<p>
  When the Romans first set foot in Britain, London wasn't their primary
  settlement. Their initial capital lay 80 kilometers northeast: present-day
  Colchester in Essex. On the other hand, Dover, the closest mainland landing
  point from continental Europe, sits 100 kilometers southeast of London. Both
  Dover and Colchester hold significance, separated by the expansive Thames
  estuary. To traverse the land, one had to loop westward around London. During
  high tide, the Thames stretched a mile wide in London, necessitating ferries.
  Yet, at low tide, its sandbars surfaced, allowing for shallow crossings.
</p>

<p>
  The spot in London that allowed these crossings was crucial. It was the
  closest point for crossing the Thames without boats and also marked the
  easternmost point where classical engineering could span the Thames with a
  bridge. In the 1st century AD, the Romans, with their superior engineering,
  entered Britain. By AD 43, they had erected a fortified city in today's London
  vicinity to safeguard a bridge they constructed over the Thames. This city was
  the Roman-era London, and the bridge, now iconic, was the London Bridge.
</p>

<p>
  The bridge became a pivotal connector for the eastern half of England,
  converging various trade routes onto London. Adjacent to the London Bridge, a
  pier facilitated ships from all corners to sail upstream the Thames. This
  strategic position enabled the city to flourish, becoming the largest in
  Roman-era Britain.
</p>

<p>
  Over two millennia, the bridge saw numerous reconstructions, yet its essence
  and location persisted. London swiftly rose to the stature of Britain's
  capital, later asserting dominance globally in the 18th and 19th centuries.
</p>

<p>
  London's existence, rather than merely hosting the London Bridge,
  fundamentally stems from it.
</p>

<p>
  Geographically, rivers meander, leading to alternating deep and shallow
  sections – essentially deep channels and shoals. Such sandbars in rivers
  facilitate easier crossings and, when dividing the channel, make each segment
  narrower and ideal for bridges. This factor, illustrated by the sandbar in
  London's Thames, situated in today's Southwark on the south bank, played a
  pivotal role. Now a part of the South Bank, Southwark once was a central
  island in the river. It's now home to key landmarks like Shakespeare's Globe
  Theater and the towering Shard.
</p>

<p>
  In essence, London's position as a trade route convergence was inevitable.
</p>

<p><strong>Sandbars, Île de la Cité</strong></p>

<p>
  Sandbars in rivers are significant geographical features. While the sandbars
  in London's River Thames aren't visible today, there is a renowned island on
  the Seine River in Paris where the Notre Dame Cathedral stands.
</p>

<p>
  This island played a pivotal role in the emergence of Paris as a major city.
  Analogous to the principle mentioned earlier, this island's location was,
  broadly speaking, the most convenient crossing point on the Seine. Long before
  the Romans set foot, during the Celtic Iron Age, this locale was a crucial
  juncture for a primary north-south trade route. This route bridged the Rhone
  Valley, where Lyon is situated, with the Seine River basin, connecting the
  Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel. Additionally, trade routes from the
  Aquitaine plains in southwestern France and the Orleans region in the south
  intersected here, leading northward to the affluent Flanders region, the
  epicenter of Europe's textile industry. By the Celtic era, Paris had already
  attained prosperity, even minting its own gold coins. Notably, Paris didn't
  source gold locally but leveraged bridge tolls and market stall fees for coin
  minting.
</p>

<p>
  The island wasn't just an optimal bridge-building spot; it was also
  strategically defensible. Naturally encircled by the river, this Seine island,
  known as Île de la Cité, the City Island, functioned as a fortress in earlier
  times. To lay siege to an island fortress, one would need both a terrestrial
  advantage to control access and a naval superiority to block the waterways,
  making such sieges considerably challenging.
</p>

<p>
  Merchants, upon crossing the bridge to the City Island, conducted their
  business within the market inside this stronghold. The feudal lords of the
  island, the Capet family and counts of Paris, safeguarded these merchants.
  They also fortified themselves with funds from these merchants.
</p>

<p><strong>Sanjo Bridge of Kyoto</strong></p>

<p>
  In ancient Japan, prior to the Middle Ages, the location of the capital
  shifted frequently. The historical capitals were situated across various
  basins and plains in the Kansai region, predominantly within the present-day
  prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara. These sites are relatively close to one
  another. By 794, the capital settled in what is now known as Kyoto, where it
  remained for over a millennium.
</p>

<p>
  The ancient route, named "Tosando," served as a connection between eastern and
  western Japan. It originated from the east, traveled through the flat terrain
  on the southern edge of Lake Biwa, and navigated through a mountain pass. This
  path led to a bridge that crossed the Kamogawa River, known as the Sanjo
  Bridge. The exact date of the bridge's original construction remains unknown.
  However, historical records indicate that in 1589, Toyotomi Hideyoshi
  instructed Masuda Nagamori to restore it, suggesting the bridge's age
  significantly predates this event.
</p>

<p>
  Numerous historical tales are associated with this bridge. One notable story
  recalls the incident at Ikedaya, near the bridge's entrance, where Sakamoto
  Ryoma, a prominent figure pushing for modernization was assassinated in 1867.
  In essence, every traveler from the Kanto region began their journey to Kyoto
  just by crossing the Sanjo Bridge, evoking a multitude of emotions and
  reflections.
</p>

<p>
  Adjacent to the bridge's entrance, a charming commercial street stands as a
  testament to the past. This area, boasting a rich history, serves as a classic
  representation of a city center from the Edo period.
</p>

<p>In essence, the Sanjo Bridge acts as a gateway to the mountain pass.</p>

<p><strong>Mountain Passes</strong></p>

<p>
  Mountain passes have historically played a crucial role in facilitating trade
  and communication between regions separated by mountain ranges. Similar to
  bridges and city gates, they often become focal points of human activity and,
  over time, can foster the development of settlements and cities in their
  vicinity.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, mountain passes present a distinct challenge: the actual passable regions
  often have limited expanses of flat, constructible land. As a result,
  significant urban developments don't typically rise directly at the mountain
  pass. Instead, they are found some distance away, where the terrain is more
  accommodating for large-scale construction and expansion.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, while the Eight Paths of the Taihang Mountains have undoubtedly
  influenced the establishment and growth of major cities at the foot of the
  Taihang Mountains, none of these cities sits directly atop the mountain pass,
  such as Juyongguan. Similarly, cities like Turin, Milan, Verona, and Treviso
  in Europe owe their strategic importance in part to their proximity to Alpine
  passes. Yet, they aren't situated right on these passes.
</p>

<p>
  Mountain passes, given their challenging terrain, are more likely to host
  smaller settlements designed to cater to travelers' immediate needs. For
  example, on the ancient route west of Tokyo, after an arduous journey over the
  mountain ridges, weary travelers would find respite in the quaint village of
  Karuizawa. Similarly, on the Tokaido route, those preparing to navigate the
  Hakone Pass, or those waiting their turn, would find rest in the small towns
  nestled at the foot of the pass. Such dynamics have given birth to traditional
  resorts near Tokyo.
</p>

<p>
  These towns and villages at or near mountain passes typically developed a
  unique culture, born out of the constant flow of diverse travelers. Over time,
  they would not just offer physical rest but would evolve to provide cultural
  and recreational experiences, making them enduring attractions in their own
  right.
