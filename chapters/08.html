<h1>08 Over the Plain and Streams</h1>
<p>(Edited on July 4, 2023 by the author)</p>

<p>As mentioned in Chapter 2:</p>

<p>
  A long-standing holy place needs to meet the following conditions: first,
  there should be no mudslides or landslides, which will make the tombstones
  disappear; second, there should be no floods accumulating silt or covering the
  original marks. Not to say that all ancient people knew how to choose such an
  location, I just visited the burial sites of the Hallstatt culture in Austria,
  which was covered by landslides for a few millennia before its recent
  rediscovery, signifying a quite common result.
</p>

<p>
  But, if one has the luck or knowledge to choose the right place, his tool of a
  united front will be there, his band may become a nation, otherwise the tool
  will be lost. This is a screening process in evolution.
</p>

<p><strong>Sanctuary Became Settlement</strong></p>

<p>
  You can find that sites with good sanctuary conditions may also be suitable
  for settlements if they have a steady supply of water and food.
</p>

<p>Every locational choice of city has advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>(Nile Delta,) (Ramses II's capital)</p>

<p>
  You may treat the city as an evolving subject. Competition and cooperation
  between cities carry on in many ways. One of the fundamentals is that city
  always needs <strong>grain and fresh water</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The distribution of cities, in most cases (we exclude a few cases, which of
  course have very strong observational value), in most cases,
  <strong
    >the distribution of cities and the distribution of cultivated land</strong
  >
  are roughly the same. Moreover, it is consistent with the distribution of
  irrigated land. There needs to be a large surplus of food in order for the
  population to gather in the cities.
</p>

<p>
  The formation of irrigated land requires technology, such as drainage, the
  technology of draining the water from swamps to form cultivated land, and
  water diversion irrigation technology. Irrigation requires the ability to
  divert water firstly, and secondly, to distribute water fairly. All the people
  participating in the project should get water as equally as possible, so as
  not to cause conflicts. Another example is that after the regular flood in the
  Nile Valley, the marks on the land were washed away, requiring a new
  organizational technique for cutting and allocating the land. These knowledges
  were often developed and kept <strong>by the priesthood</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The development process of plains is characterized by gradual change, and it
  is worth noting that some areas that appear as plains today were once
  predominantly swamps or wetlands in ancient times. A striking example of this
  transformation can be observed in the lower reaches of the Yellow River,
  spanning from Jinan to the north, extending southward to the region below
  Tianjin, including the Xiongan New District. This vast expanse of land was
  previously a sprawling wetland prior to the Warring States Period, with no
  recorded cities or notable settlements. As the water level gradually receded
  from the late Warring States period to the Han Dynasty, the area underwent
  development, <strong>the recession of the wetland</strong> eventually giving
  rise to the establishment of Bohai County and Pingyuan County
  (渤海郡和平原郡). Consequently, the population density in this region began to
  increase.
</p>

<p>
  The emergence of prominent cities such as Cangzhou, Dezhou, and Tianjin can be
  attributed to the flourishing Yuan and Ming canal shipping industry.
</p>

<p>
  Among the most significant plains are the middle and lower reaches of the
  Yellow River Plain, the Mesopotamia Plain, the Nile Valley, and the Indus and
  Ganges River Plains. These expansive plains boast the longest history of
  agricultural development and encompass the largest areas. It is on such
  fertile irrigated lands and vast plains that the ancient world's four major
  agricultural civilizations and urban conglomerations thrived.
</p>

<p>
  (figure above: use the Po Valley as an example, most of the larger cities
  avoid the bottom of the valley and lie near the mountain base, particularly
  where a branch stream enters the valley. Mantua lies on a small mount in the
  middle of the valley. Ferrara, Venice and Ravenna seem to be the exceptions,
  whose ecomony were more dependent on the waters of the Po Delta. )
</p>

<p><strong>Larger and Smaller Plains and Valleys</strong></p>

<p>
  Naturally, beyond these prominent plains, there are numerous other vast and
  smaller-scale plains that have also facilitated the growth of notable cities.
  For instance, the Ganges River Delta, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River
  Delta, several plains in Java Island, the Po River Plain, and the plains in
  southern Russia and Ukraine, to name a few. While it is impractical to list
  them all, these regions have contributed to the establishment of significant
  urban centers.
</p>

<p>
  Relatively large valleys are sufficient for the presence of a single or
  multiple cities. A notable example is Mexico City, situated in a fertile
  valley that benefited from abundant irrigation and ample sunlight due to its
  low latitude. Utilizing Stone Age technologies, the indigenous managed to form
  a large city of 200,000 to 300,000 people even before the colonial era/
  without metal tools. Similar patterns can be observed in other regions, such
  as Taiyuan, the largest city in Shanxi, and various cities located in the vast
  Fen River valley, as well as Jincheng and Changzhi situated in the Shangdang
  Valley, and Datong positioned in the Sanggan River Valley. Smaller cities,
  too, can be found in smaller valleys.
</p>

<p>
  Japan has three largers plains. The first and most notable is the Kanto Plain,
  which encompasses Tokyo, the bustling capital city. The second is the plain
  area that encompasses Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, which holds great historical and
  cultural significance. Lastly, we have the Nobi Plain, where Nagoya is
  located, serving as a vital economic hub. It is worth mentioning the potential
  fourth significant plain, the Ishikari Plain, where Sapporo, a major city, is
  situated.
</p>

<p>
  Among the five Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan stands as the largest,
  covering a vast expanse of 2.7 million square kilometers with a population of
  16.71 million. Uzbekistan, although smaller with an area of 450,000 square
  kilometers, which is about one-sixth the size of Kazakhstan, boasts a
  population of 19.9 million. This is primarily due to the presence of extensive
  plain agricultural areas in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya valleys, which have
  historically supported the dense concentration of ancient city-states like
  Samarkand, Bukhara, Tashkent, and Khwarazm.
</p>

<p>
  In Yunnan, China, the Hengduan Mountains bear resemblance in size and
  elevation to the Valley of Mexico. However, due to the narrowness of the
  valley and limited arable land, it has not been able to develop a city of
  similarly large population.

  avoid the bottom of the valley and lie near the mountain base, particularly
  where a branch stream enters the valley. Mantua lies on a small mount in the
  middle of the valley. Ferrara, Venice and Ravenna seem to be the exceptions,
  whose ecomony were more dependent on the waters of the Po Delta. )
</p>

<p><strong>On the Edge</strong></p>

<p>
  The size of city-states is closely linked to the amount of cultivated land
  they can control in their surroundings. Every plain with hundreds of square
  kilometers of arable land becomes a significant site for the establishment of
  an important city. However, it is <strong>NOT</strong> necessary for these
  cities to be located <strong>in the middle of the plain</strong>. Typically,
  they are situated near rivers traversing the plain, close to mountain base,
  and relatively upstream.
</p>

<p>
  The availability of water is a crucial factor, and the
  <strong>degradation </strong>of water sources can lead to a decline in the
  quality of cultivated land. This phenomenon is particularly evident in certain
  valleys. A prime example is the ancient city of Angkor, where declining water
  levels and the subsequent loss of irrigation resulted in the decline of this
  once thriving civilization.
</p>

<p><strong>Grain Imports </strong></p>

<p>
  There are, of course, exceptions to the rule. Some large cities have limited
  arable land in their immediate vicinity, yet their size surpasses that of the
  surrounding cultivated areas. Ancient metropolises like Syracuse, Athens,
  Rome, and Venice fall into this category. These cities heavily relied on
  sea-borne transportation for importing food from distant regions. Neither did
  the cities such as Kaifeng and Beijing in ancient times depend on local food
  production but rather relied on the canal transportated food from the regions
  on the Yangtze River.
</p>

<p>
  In the modern world, it has become a common phenomenon for large cities to
  detach themselves from dependence on surrounding areas for food production and
  instead rely heavily on distant food imports. However, this trend is
  relatively recent and does not have a long history.
</p>

<p>
  As an exception, we exclude the plains in the southern United States or the
  plains of the Congo River in Africa, which are larger but later developed.
</p>

<p><strong>Fresh Water</strong></p>

<p>
  In addition to food, water is indispensable and needs to be solved nearby.
</p>

<p>
  The foundation of Jerusalem's existence is its constant water supply, Gihon
  Spring, or Our Lady's Spring. Since the Stone Age, it has been the place where
  shepherds and merchants obtain water. In arid regions, water is the greatest
  strategic resource. It almost guarantees the development of a location.
</p>

<p><strong>The Connection between Water and Market</strong></p>

<p>
  Judging from the current archaeological excavations, as early as the Bronze
  Age, there was a fortress guarding the spring. Those who guard this spring can
  charge a fee. It may not be in the form of collecting water fees, but by
  operating the <strong>market</strong> and collecting market fees. This spring
  is still there today, under the ancient city, the so-called City of David.
  Around this spring, there are very complex reservoirs and waterway works. This
  spring water system is famous because it is mentioned several times in the
  Bible. The stories are very rich. Legend has it that David conquered Jerusalem
  by adopting Shawshank's way of redemption.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, slipped in from a waterway mouth, and suddenly attacked from the
  inside. The captured Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
  The water resource of a city is, of course, a matter of life and death. Here
  are some <strong>common solutions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  1) Venice collects rainwater and stores it in <strong>water cellars</strong>.
  Everyone went to the mouth of the water cellar to get water. However, the
  water collected in this way is relatively small and needs to be used
  sparingly.
</p>

<p><strong>Upstream Privilege</strong></p>

<p>
  2) There is a river, and it is possible to draw water from the river. However,
  for relatively large cities, it is inevitable that the sewage will also be
  discharged into the river. In this way, the river water may be polluted. Take
  London as an example, The water from the upper reaches of West London is
  relatively clean; while the water flowing to East London is already very
  dirty, and people downstream drinking this water are at risk of intestinal
  diseases. And the water doesn't taste good either.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, the improvement of sewer systems is crucial, preferably by
  bypassing the entire city and diverting them downstream. This technology has
  been well-established in ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, the Indus
  Valley, and the Roman era. However, urban technological advancements
  deteriorated on a large scale after the classical age, leading to the absence
  of sewer systems in many areas and times.
</p>

<p>
  Consequently, a situation arises where wealthy individuals or nobles can
  afford to live upstream near clean water sources, while those who work in the
  city have to make do with ordinary water.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, in Beijing, we observe that the Emperor's Palace, the Old Summer
  Palace, and other noble residences are located in the Xiangshan to Haidian
  area, benefiting from first-hand mountain spring water.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, in London, Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace are situated
  upstream along the Thames River.
</p>

<p>
  Vienna's imperial palace, Schönbrunn Palace, is also strategically located on
  the outskirts, where the mountain springs are transformed into picturesque
  waterfalls cascading down the hillsides.
</p>

<p>
  Hence, some of the water features we see serve not only as decorative
  showcases but also as drinking water projects. In other words, drinking water
  projects are transformed into decorative and prestigious displays.
</p>

<p><strong>Massive Public Works for Water Supply</strong></p>

<p>
  In terms of drinking water engineering, the ancient Roman era demonstrated far
  greater maturity than the situations described above. They constructed water
  delivery channels, called aqueducts, spanning several kilometers or even
  dozens of kilometers from the surrounding mountains to directly supply
  mountain spring water to the city. These aqueducts typically took the form of
  viaducts, often consisting of multiple lines complementing each other to
  ensure a stable supply of drinking water. Remarkably, some of the ancient
  aqueducts in Rome remained functional until modern times.
</p>

<p>
  Initially, witnessing these waterways was astonishing for me. However, it soon
  became apparent that such infrastructure was unearthed in numerous cities
  across Europe, and it was considered standard equipment of that era. Large and
  small cities, as well as military camps, were all equipped with these systems.
  Even a Roman military camp with fewer than 10,000 people, including the
  garrison and their families, had well-designed waterworks. This reflects the
  significant efforts the Romans invested in municipal engineering. Ordinary
  people would access water from public outlets, while the wealthy and public
  buildings, such as bathhouses, would receive direct water supply.
</p>

<p>
  The ancient fountains in Italian cities, hundreds of thousands of years old,
  relied on natural gravity as they received water from the end of the
  waterways. Notably, these fountains were not powered by electricity ( in
  contrast to almost all modern chinese fountains.
</p>

<p>
  Modern urban water supply schemes closely resemble those of ancient Rome,
  drawing clean mountain spring water from upstream sources. In fact, the area
  of the upstream water intake in a modern city is often several times larger
  than the city itself. This holds true for cities like Beijing and New York.
  Due to relatively low natural precipitation in temperate monsoon areas, a
  larger collection area is required.
</p>

<p>
  Singapore, being a small city-state with a large population, experiences
  higher rainfall due to its equatorial location. Hence, its drinking water
  collection area can be smaller. Singapore has implemented specific engineering
  measures to protect these watersheds and prevent drinking water pollution. The
  city-state has created reservoirs by separating bays from the sea, bringing in
  fresh water and conducting environmental treatments in the surrounding areas
  to divert pollution sources and sewage systems. This constitutes a massive
  engineering feat.
</p>

<p><strong>Water Failures</strong></p>

<p>
  In the absence of aqueducts and with serious surface water pollution, reliance
  on groundwater through wells becomes necessary. Wells are a viable solution
  for small villages, but when it comes to large cities, challenges arise.
</p>

<p>
  If various forms of waste and wastewater produced by ancient cities cannot be
  effectively discharged downstream, the polluted surface waters gradually
  contaminate the groundwater. Over time, the groundwater becomes unfit for
  drinking.
</p>

<p>
  This is why the Sui Dynasty did not continue using the ancient city of
  Chang'an but opted to build a larger new city from scratch.
</p>

<p>
  Beijing faced a similar situation, where most of the Yuan Dynasty did not
  continue using the old city from the Liao and Jin Dynasties. This was not due
  to a preference for the new over the old; rather, it was because the
  groundwater in these ancient cities was highly polluted.
</p>

<p>Therefore, it is common to find ancient cities moving overtime.</p>

<p>
  During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the courts did not rely on well water but
  transported clear water from the Western Mountains using water trucks. This
  type of water supply was expensive and exclusive.
</p>

<p><strong>Silting</strong></p>

<p>
  Pi-Ramesses was a grand city constructed by Ramses II and was one of the
  largest and most opulent cities in ancient Egypt. It was originally thought
  the demise of Egyptian authority abroad during the Twentieth Dynasty of
  Egypt made the city less significant, leading to its abandonment as a royal
  residence. It is now known that the Pelusiac branch of the Nile began silting
  up c. 1060 BCE, leaving the city without water when the river eventually
  established a new course to the west now called the Tanitic branch, leading to
  the city's abandonment and subsequent deterioration.
</p>

<p><strong>The Well/Fountain, the Square and the Market Place</strong></p>

<p>
  Wells and water outlets are essential public facilities and share similarities
  with temples. A small square is often found near the mouth of a well, serving
  as a natural gathering place for various communities in the city. In some
  cities, free markets even take place there. Sometimes, wells are located
  adjacent to or integrated with churches and temples. In Beijing, the small
  streets called Hutongs derive their name from the word "well." A street
  naturally forms a geographical community centered around the mouth of a well.
</p>

<p><strong>Monumental Fountains</strong></p>

<p>
  Now and then decorations are incorporated into beautiful fountains to showcase
  the city's wealth and promote the prestige of the benefactors.
</p>
