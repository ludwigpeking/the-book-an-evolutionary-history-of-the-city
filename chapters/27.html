<h1>27 Organicity and Contextuality</h1>

<p><strong>Organicity in Organism</strong></p>

<p>
  Every individual starts from a single fertilized egg cell. This one cell
  divides into two, then four, and after countless divisions, by the time we
  mature, we consist of approximately 37.2 trillion (3.72 x 10¹³) cells. These
  cells form the four main types of tissues and 78 different organs within the
  human body. Each of these tissues and organs has a unique structure, and the
  cells vary among them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Muscle tissue cells are fibrous.</li>

  <li>Neuronal cells from the nervous tissue extend long axons.</li>

  <li>Cells in bone tissue present a stellate pattern.</li>

  <li>
    Lymphatic and blood cells float freely within their respective fluids.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Organs each have their intricate designs. For instance, a tooth, which is an
  organ, has a mineral-rich hard outer shell, with dentin in the middle and a
  cavity containing nerves and blood vessels. The trachea, another organ, looks
  like the drain hose of a washing machine, with a series of cartilage rings. It
  divides into branches leading to the lungs. The appearance and destinies of
  cells are immensely varied. A neuronal cell can be over 1.5 meters long, while
  a red blood cell is just 5 micrometers in length—a 300,000-fold difference.
  Neurons can live for over a century, but the cells lining the stomach live
  only a few days—a difference in lifespan by ten thousand times.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, it's essential to remember that all these cells originated from that
  initial fertilized egg, undergoing mitosis and self-replication, all carrying
  identical chromosomes and genetic information. How does this differentiation
  process occur?
</p>

<p>
  After the initial cell divides several times, producing a cluster of cells,
  these cells recognize their position by chemical signals from their
  neighboring cells. If a cell is surrounded on all sides by other cells, it's
  in the center; if it has neighbors only on one side, it's on the outer
  surface. These positional stresses alter the transcription factors inside
  them, switching on different genes. This leads to differentiation into various
  embryonic layers.
</p>

<p>
  At this stage, the embryo is still amorphous, with no distinguishable head or
  tail. Any position could develop into the head or the buttocks of the
  individual. However, once it attaches to the uterine wall, signals from the
  uterus induce the embryo to differentiate its head and tail. The upper and
  lower halves activate different genetic switches, producing different proteins
  and releasing varied chemical signals. Influenced by these signals of varying
  intensities and characteristics, the cells divide and differentiate into arms,
  chest, heart, liver, and various other organs. Each cell autonomously
  differentiates to harmonize with its surrounding cells. If a cell from the
  upper body, for example, develops out of sync with its surroundings into a
  type suited for the lower body, abnormalities result.
</p>

<p>
  It's only through such intricate coordination that organs differentiate
  correctly. While a mature individual might seem ordinary, this "ordinary"
  development is, in fact, a genuine miracle.
</p>

<p><strong>Analogys to Morphogenesis</strong></p>

<p>
  Cities are often likened to living organisms, complete with analogous
  mechanisms at work.
</p>

<p>
  City walls function as the city's exoskeleton, with gates serving as its
  mouth; streets act as its circulatory system; markets are its lungs; barracks
  represent its fists; police and prisons function as its lymphatic system.
  Landmarks such as the Kremlin and the Tower of London stand as the city's
  skull, housing governing entities that act as its brain.
</p>

<p>
  Cities around the world vary in appearance, yet on a macro level, they display
  striking similarities. Such shared characteristics arise from underlying human
  behaviors common across civilizations. Every building in a city, every
  drainage channel, stems from an individual decision-making process, mirroring
  the behavior of a dividing cell. But unlike cells, humans are swayed by a
  multitude of factors. Still, typically, every building's construction displays
  a heightened sensitivity to its environment.
</p>

<p><strong>Differentiation/Contextuality</strong></p>

<p>
  Houses near city gates or main streets? They often become shops, leading to
  the formation of commercial streets. Areas around wells or temples? They
  attract bustling crowds, making way for markets. Land situated far from main
  roads and gates, especially if low-lying, is less suitable for shops or
  residences, and more fitting for stables or vegetable gardens. Steep slopes?
  They're often transformed into terraced platforms for development, utilizing
  the natural topography to minimize the need for extensive land grading.
</p>

<p>
  If your neighbors' homes are built with stone and you're considering bricks,
  research might reveal that the local abundance of cheap stone makes
  brick-making unprofitable. Importing bricks from afar would be too costly.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, if neighboring buildings are five stories high and you're thinking
  of building only two, you might earn less. Erecting an eight-story building
  might be inconvenient for potential renters due to the climb, or might be met
  with resistance from neighbors due to its dominating presence. More often than
  not, your building will likely deviate only slightly in height from those
  surrounding it.
</p>

<p>
  The architectural styles commonly adopted by your community often reflect
  accumulated experiences, cost-effective materials, local craftsmanship, and
  efficient design. Stubbornly choosing a non-standard design could lead to
  regrets.
</p>

<p>
  Anyone who has studied a foreign language will be familiar with cloze tests,
  where words are omitted from a text and have to be filled in. The options to
  consider are usually limited. Similarly, in architecture, the feasible
  solutions offered by a given environment are finite.
</p>

<p>
  Well-coordinated decisions respect various considerations and anticipate
  potential consequences. In urban studies, this concept is termed "contextual"
  or "contextuality"—meaning decisions that respect and consider surrounding
  environments.
</p>

<p>
  Some translate it to "文脉" in Chinese, but this neologism can be hard to
  understand for some. At its core, it's a straightforward term meaning
  harmonious integration with the surroundings.
</p>

<p>
  Traditional cities, as evolutionary victors, often feature buildings that,
  individually, might seem understated and blend into the background. Yet,
  collectively, they form vibrant, efficient landscapes.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, during the Qing Dynasty, there were no laws dictating that only
  courtyard houses (四合院) should be built in Beijing. Yet, over 90% of houses
  followed this design. Similarly, the ruins of ancient Pompeii in Italy reveal
  that about 90% were courtyard houses. Despite the 8,000 kilometers and over a
  millennium separating the two locations, both arrived at nearly identical
  architectural typology, suggesting the courtyard design was particularly
  viable in those contexts.
</p>

<p>
  Whales, descendants of a furry mammal resembling a weasel, after thousands of
  generations in the ocean, evolved to somewhat resemble sharks, distant
  relatives. Specific environments tend to steer evolution toward analogous
  outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  I mentioned the concept of "organicity" in the first installment of "The
  Cliché Pulverizer." Organicity doesn't simply pertain to winding, intricate
  appearances; such a facade might represent pseudo-organicity. True organicity
  implies comprehensive coordination.
</p>

<p>
  The antithesis of coordination and contextuality in decision-making is
  "arbitrariness." Being arbitrary means making decisions with limited external
  considerations, insufficient information, and impulsive behavior. History is
  rife with examples of arbitrariness. Urban planning, in particular, has a
  history marked by numerous failures. There are many books discussing these
  failed instances. For example, Kenneth Kolson's "Big Plans: The Allure and
  Folly of Urban Design" delves into instances of arbitrariness in American
  urban planning history. In the midst of economic growth, an arbitrary urban
  plan might appear successful and functional on the surface. However, its
  essence is consumptive, merely hitching a ride on the era's coattails and
  draining the vitality of society. Yet, arbitrariness is straightforward, while
  true coordination requires knowledge, patience, and, most importantly,
  intricate organizational efforts.
