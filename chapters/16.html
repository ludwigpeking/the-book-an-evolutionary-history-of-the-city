    >Passenger Time Spent in Mode Changes and the Concentration of
    Commerce</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  In the last segment, we discussed how goods often need to change owners and
  transportation modes during their journey. These switches require extensive
  loading and unloading activities, which consume a significant amount of labor
  and resources. Cities that have effectively minimized these costs while
  generating value during these transitional periods have naturally developed
  industries such as trade, finance, and services, largely around docks and
  warehouses. This is primarily targeted at the mode-switching of goods.
</p>

<p>
  However, switching between different modes of transportation also requires
  humans to spend a considerable amount of time in transit. Seasoned travelers
  usually allocate a margin for uncertainty in their trips, arriving at the
  station 20 to 30 minutes before their train's departure. Layovers for flights
  often span several hours. Even waiting for a bus often takes up to ten or
  fifteen minutes. The time spent waiting for and transferring between modes of
  transportation can often exceed the actual ride time.
</p>

<p>
  To pass the time during these waits for planes or trains, people will often
  eat or shop, making these high-demand activities at stations. Take the
  traditional Beijing area of Qianmen, where two major terminals lied together.
  It was also a bustling hub for dining and shopping during its era.
</p>

<p>
  The world's busiest station is Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, where many of Tokyo's
  best cafés are also conveniently located.
</p>

<p>
  In Osaka, the primary station is Umeda, where two major railway systems, JR
  and Hankyu, coexist side by side. Osaka's main shopping centers are
  concentrated in Umeda, a result of a long-standing tradition.
</p>

<p>
  A fine grocery market of New York City is located within the 42nd Street
  Central Station. Occupying an elongated space, the market itself serves as a
  pathway for commuters. It offers the utmost convenience for picking up
  groceries before or after work.
</p>

<p>
  People living or working along the same rail line, or different lines,
  naturally choose a mutually accessible and familiar station for meetings.
  Inside New York's Central Station, the oyster restaurant is a popular spot for
  the city's upper class to discuss work.
</p>

<p>
  Washington Union Station, situated between Pennsylvania Avenue, the White
  House, and Capitol Hill, is a prime location for the city's movers and shakers
  to meet for meals, even if they don't necessarily have a train to catch.
</p>

<p>
  In Haruki Murakami's novels, writers often meet at some café in Shinjuku. In
  the TV show "Tokyo Tarareba Girls," women meet at the west exit of Ebisu
  Station after work to attend social events together.
</p>

<p>
  Large stations are well-known locations, with their surrounding shops making
  excellent meeting points.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Office Locations Near Transit Hubs</strong><br />If many people take
  the train to work, it makes sense to locate offices within walking distance of
  stations to maximize convenience for these commuters. Walking is a unique mode
  of transportation because it requires no technology and incurs no cost. If you
  exit a subway station and find that your destination is just beyond walking
  distance, necessitating a cab ride, your commuting expenses can increase
  significantly. The comfortable walking distance for most people is around a
  kilometer or within 15 minutes. Locating a company near a major interchange
  station significantly reduces employees' transportation costs and makes office
  development near stations an attractive option.
</p>

<p>
  This leads to the phenomenon where office buildings are clustered around
  stations. Such clustering has inherent value. For example, in Hong Kong's
  Central and Admiralty districts, a banker may have meetings with various
  clients located within a few hundred meters. Walking 10 minutes could suffice
  for a highly efficient workday. These concentrations of office buildings also
  support a range of other services and facilities around the station.
</p>

<p>

    >Multi-Functional Spaces Over Transit Hubs: The Case of Madison Square
    Garden</strong
  ><br />Interestingly, New York's primary basketball and hockey venue, Madison
  Square Garden, also hosts numerous concerts. Its location is much more central
  than its equivalents in cities like Shanghai or Beijing. Madison Square Garden
  is located directly above Penn Station, sharing the same footprint. This
  arrangement allows both team members and spectators to reach the venue via
  direct transit. One unique feature of such a venue is the lack of extensive
  parking facilities. On the one hand, space is at a premium, and on the other,
  Penn Station's parking can be used.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>The Evolution of Multi-Functional Spaces Near Transit Hubs</strong
  ><br />Through these observations, we see that dining, shopping, working,
  social gatherings, and entertainment are all naturally clustered around
  significant transit stations. Urban spaces near these hubs evolve
  spontaneously to integrate these activities, almost inevitably becoming city
  centers in the absence of any disruptive human intervention. This phenomenon
  began with the advent of passenger transit routes. After over a century of
  development, it was formally named "Transit-Oriented Development" (TOD) by
  urban planner Peter Calthorpe in the 1970s. Only then did people seem to "wake
  up" to this reality, inspiring further theoretical exploration.
</p>

<p><b>Understanding Stations as Fields of Influence</b></p>

<p>
  To clarify this topic, let's use an analogy that is easier to grasp for people
  with a scientific background. A station can be conceptualized as a field, much
  like a gravitational, electric, or magnetic field, where the intensity is
  inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center.
</p>

<p><b>The Dynamic Flow of People Around Stations</b></p>

<p>
  People disperse in all directions as they leave the station. Within a few
  dozen meters of the station's entrances, the human flow can be tens or even
  hundreds of times higher than on regular streets. Consequently, the efficiency
  of commercial facilities here is unparalleled. In reality, the highest rents
  are for these shops. The rents can be several tens or even hundreds of times
  higher than in residential areas.
</p>

<p><b>Circles of Influence Around Stations</b></p>

<p>
  The true inner circle of influence is within 50 meters of the station exits.
  Though this area is small, its per-square-meter value is extremely high. The
  middle circle can extend up to 200 meters; the value here remains quite high.
  Once you go beyond to the outer circle, the value becomes average.
</p>

<p><b>The Devil in the Details</b></p>

<p>
  In optimal station development, the inner and middle circles may be small, but
  they must be utilized to their full potential to capture value. For example,
  the best Hankyu department stores in Osaka are located within the inner
  circle. Properly capitalizing on this space isn't straightforward due to the
  need for bus stops and taxi stands, which take up a lot of space.
</p>

<p>
  Ineffective designers might opt for large, empty plazas. These plazas can
  consume not only the inner circle but also the middle circle, leaving only the
  outer edges for office buildings and hotels, thereby wasting the value that
  could be generated from the flow of people.
</p>

<p><b>Space Utilization in World-Class Station Designs</b></p>

<p>
  Excellent station area designs leave no room for waste. Every bit of space
  should be optimized, including that for transportation facilities. Kyoto
  Station, for instance, maximizes utility by having department stores, hotels,
  art galleries, and theaters within or above the station. In contrast, New
  York's Grand Central Station offers an even more brilliant case. Skyscrapers
  rise directly above it, with pillars filling the gaps between the railway
  tracks. Above these pillars is one of the most famous communities, Park
  Avenue, a luxurious residential and business district. Had previous
  generations not shown such foresight, what would Midtown Manhattan be like
  today?
</p>

<p>
  Kyoto Station serves as an excellent example of station planning, while New
  York's Grand Central Station stands as a magnificent one. Both showcase the
  importance of understanding the dynamics of human flow around transit hubs and
  leveraging this to maximize value.
</p>

<p><strong>Three Generations of CBDs</strong></p>

<p>
  Commercial districts throughout history have evolved through different phases.
  The first generation usually centered around temples or churches. In imperial
  cities, streets outside the royal castle were often the focal points for the
  residences of courtiers and shops catering to elites. The second generation
  was represented by port districts like Lower Manhattan in New York and the
  Bund in Shanghai. The third generation, which is the focus of our current
  discussion, revolves around transit hubs—active Transit-Oriented Developments
  (TODs).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Early Stations around the Peripheries of the Traditional City</strong>
</p>

<p>
  When we speak of stations today, we often refer to subway stations. However,
  in the 19th century, the differentiation between subway and other urban
  railways was not as clear. Early stations often served the dual role of both
  long-distance and commuter transit. These stations were usually built on the
  outskirts of cities. In many cities, this remains the case.
</p>

<p>
  Early stations were generally constructed on the peripheries of traditional
  city centers. A helpful trick to understand the history of a city is to
  connect the locations of its multiple train stations, which usually outline
  the extent of the city's 19th-century core.
</p>

<p><strong>New Centers</strong></p>

<p>
  Over time, these periphery stations often evolved into new city centers due to
  the high transportation capacity of railways. This phenomenon, known as
  'latecomer advantage,' may sound paradoxical, but the key factor is the advent
  of transformative technologies.
</p>

<p>
  Cities often have multiple stations that each develop their own commercial
  districts. By looking at the distribution of transit options and their
  respective influence, one can often make educated guesses about the relative
  importance of these commercial centers within the city.
</p>

<p><strong>Case Study: Osaka and New York</strong></p>

<p>
  For instance, Osaka's Umeda station in the north connects major lines and is
  more significant than Namba station in the south, which connects less
  influential routes. In New York, Penn Station and Grand Central Station were
  built at the 19th-century outskirts but later became the epicenters of Midtown
  Manhattan, the world’s most important financial district.
</p>

<p>
  Midtown Manhattan developed around two main hubs, Penn Station and Grand
  Central Station, which can be likened to a binary star system. Each station
  has its own field of influence, but they also interact, creating a complex
  gravitational pull that shapes the commercial landscape between them.
</p>

<p><strong>Banking around Stations</strong></p>

<p>
  Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are both situated within a kilometer of
  these two stations. They take advantage of the 'gravitational pull' of both
  stations, positioned strategically along major avenues leading uptown.
  Citigroup, on the other hand, is closer to Grand Central, becoming part of its
  sphere of influence.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, the success of urban development often hinges on understanding and
  leveraging the dynamics of human flow around transit hubs. The complexities
  increase when multiple hubs are involved, as evident in cities like New York,
  which have successfully created world-leading commercial districts around
  their main stations.
</p>

<p><strong>T.O.D.</strong></p>

<p>
  After discussing various urban stations, I'd like to touch briefly on suburban
  stations and their corresponding TOD (Transit-Oriented Development)
  implementations, which are not to be overlooked.
</p>

<p>
  In many ways, suburban areas mimic the structures of urban settings, albeit
  with lower densities, less foot traffic, and consequently, reduced commercial
  value. Residential properties within walking distance of suburban stations
  often command higher prices compared to those requiring additional transit.
  For instance, in some suburbs near Washington, D.C., the price difference can
  be nearly twofold. In Japan, one of the most critical details in real estate
  listings, aside from the size of the property, is the walking distance to the
  nearest station. The value of residences around stations tends to decay slower
  than that of commercial districts, declining more uniformly within a kilometer
  radius. In other words, a subway station brings noticeable added value to
  residences within its one-kilometer radius.
</p>

<p><strong>Park and Ride</strong></p>

<p>
  Commuters use various modes of transportation to reach these stations,
  including walking, buses, biking, or driving. Therefore, parking facilities
  can sometimes become very prominent features of suburban stations,
  particularly in American cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C. Parking lots
  are actually another form of modal transition points. While the number of
  people a large parking lot can accommodate is not comparable to a transit
  station, it could still be a significant congregation point within a city. The
  flow of people entering and exiting the parking areas can also take advantage
  of commercial facilities. In large outlet malls, stores near the parking
  entrances usually enjoy prime locations. Savvy developers might also place
  retail stores at strategic points within the parking infrastructure, such as
  on the first floor of a parking garage.
</p>

<p><strong>Aerotropolis</strong></p>

<p>
  Airports share some structural similarities with stations but suffer a
  significant disadvantage: the large space taken up by tarmacs and runways
  dilutes urban density considerably. Thus, while airport business districts are
  also considered a typical form of commercial district, known as
  'aerotropolis,' their scale and importance can't be equated with those
  surrounding stations.
</p>
