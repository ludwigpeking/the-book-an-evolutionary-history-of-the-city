<h1>18 the Evolution of Commercial Communities (2) Pedestrian Driven</h1>

<p><strong>Understanding Modes</strong></p>

<p>
  The underlying logic of urban commercial systems was clarified in the last
  installment. Now, let's revisit chapter 91-92 (or 13-14 of this series), where
  we discussed how transportation modes profoundly affect our world.
</p>

<p>
  Urban commercial systems are a product of past transportation habits, are
  currently influenced by existing modes, and will evolve according to future
  transportation trends. In analyzing commercial patterns, reports often provide
  metrics like population within a three-kilometer radius or within a
  five-kilometer radius. While these indicators have value, they're relatively
  coarse measures that don't capture the essence of transportation and
  population dynamics.
</p>

<p>
  Economic activities are not bounded by distance in kilometers but are more
  appropriately classified by modes of transportation—whether people walk, bike,
  ride motorcycles, drive cars, take buses, or even fly. Transportation costs,
  encompassing both time and resources, constitute a significant and sensitive
  component of the overall production and transaction costs.
</p>

<p>
  Any decision you make, regardless of its underlying motive, will gain a
  competitive edge if it reduces the system's transportation costs. On the other
  hand, if your design significantly elevates these costs, it risks punishment
  through market forces and may ultimately be phased out. That's how evolution
  works.
</p>

<p>
  In the context of modern cities, it's crucial to understand the inherent
  traits of various primary transportation modes. By grasping these nuances, one
  can develop methods to make these transportation systems more efficient,
  cost-effective, user-friendly, and valuable in competitive markets, all while
  achieving intellectual aesthetic.
</p>

<p><strong>Walking: The Foundational Layer of Mobility</strong></p>

<p>
  Let's first delve into the elementary stratum of mobility: walking. The
  significance of walking as a mode of transportation is twofold.
</p>

<p>
  Firstly, the built environments where we spend our lives—homes, offices, and
  stores—are fundamentally architected around the walking experience. Except for
  those who rely on wheelchairs, walking is the default. This implicates that
  designers of commercial spaces, as well as those focusing on interior,
  residential, and industrial design, must cultivate an acute understanding of
  walking as a primary mode of human movement.
</p>

<p>
  Secondly, regardless of the main mode of transportation—be it taking the bus
  or driving a car—the first and last stretches of any journey involve walking.
  From home to parking lot, from parking lot to station—these are spans
  traversed on foot. This is particularly true for mass transit systems like
  subways and buses, where pedestrian transit links the dots between various
  modes. Should the walking environment be inefficient or unpleasant, it
  undermines the overall effectiveness and desirability of the public transport
  system itself. Without a robust walking infrastructure, there can be no robust
  public transportation.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, walking retains its crown as the most vital mode of urban
  transportation, even today. While its share in many cities may have
  diminished, it remains the most fundamental and economical option. In contrast
  to other forms of transit, walking costs not money, but time.
</p>

<p>
  Strictly speaking, walking also consumes energy that must be replenished with
  food, entailing a cost. However, in societies replete with excess nutrition,
  this caloric expenditure often becomes a form of enjoyment rather than a
  burden.
</p>

<p>
  Walking offers tangible economic benefits. Those who walk to work save on the
  purchase of a vehicle, on fuel costs, on parking spaces, on insurance
  premiums, on taxes, and on maintenance—potentially amounting to savings of
  thousands per month. Consequently, walking serves as a societal boon; it is
  equitable, benefiting the lower-income classes and those just entering the
  workforce by easing their financial burdens and accelerating their social
  upward mobility. It acts as both a social stabilizer and an incubator for
  innovation.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, compared to other modes of transportation, walking's carbon
  footprint and environmental impact are virtually negligible. It neither
  requires large vehicles nor consumes significant resources, and it obviates
  the need for extensive parking facilities. Hence, as a component of an urban
  ecosystem, walking is the most sustainable form of transport. Cities like New
  York, where walking is most prevalent, are also those that generate the
  highest GDP for the energy consumed. Of course, the challenge remains to
  improve walking speed for covering longer distances.
</p>

<p><strong>Walking: An Historical and Socio-Spatial Perspective</strong></p>

<p>
  Walking, as a form of transit, has ancient roots. Before the advent of the
  industrial age, while there were modes like horse-drawn carriages, these were
  used by a minority. Walking was the dominant form of urban movement. All
  traditional cities—those that came into being before the era of
  automobiles—evolved around this form of mobility.
</p>

<p>
  Consider ancient cities with populations under 7,000—a figure that would
  qualify only as a small town in the modern world. Yet, in antiquity, this was
  considered a medium-sized city primarily inhabited by tradespeople or
  professional soldiers. The businesses and professions found in these cities
  far outnumbered those in a modern small town of equivalent population. These
  traditional cities had an area proportionate to their population, usually
  extending to about a mile in diameter once the population reached around
  7,000. Given this scale, all inhabitants were generally within 800 meters of
  the city center, reachable within 10 minutes by foot at an average pace of 80
  meters per minute. Whether heading to a church, workplace, market, or
  entertainment venue, everything was close by.
</p>

<p>
  Even in inclement weather, this commuting distance wasn't particularly
  burdensome—an indicator of a high quality of life. But as populations grew,
  individuals favored central locations over peripheral ones, sacrificing space
  to increase density. The expansion of the city slowed, with population density
  growing unevenly across the center. Network effects amplified the land value
  in main commercial zones, leading to a decline in courtyards and an increase
  in multi-story buildings.
</p>

<p>
  The limitation in density was essentially a constraint set by architectural
  technology. In the absence of modern innovations like elevators and steel
  frameworks, buildings could not exceed six stories. Carthage mostly had
  six-story structures, whereas ancient Rome had apartments that reached up to
  11 stories—quite an ascent without elevators. People were willing to climb
  because the alternative, residing further away, was less appealing.
</p>

<p>
  Even if we haven’t seen these ancient metropolises, contemporary “urban
  villages” in Shenzhen, Dongguan, or the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City in
  Hong Kong serve as analogous models of self-organized complexity. Most
  significant ancient cities did not exceed diameters of two or three kilometers
  and could sustain populations between 100,000 to 200,000. The population
  density, therefore, would range between 20,000 to 60,000 individuals per
  square kilometer, making these cities far denser than most modern urban
  centers.
</p>

<p>
  From a military standpoint, a defense force of a few thousand could
  effectively guard a wall a few kilometers long. Hence, many renowned cities
  were strategically placed near natural barriers to reduce the length of their
  defensive walls. Urban sprawl was anathema in an age when distance was
  measured in walking time.
</p>

<p>
  The compact and walk-friendly character of traditional cities has been labeled
  as “Smart Growth” in the United States and more frequently as “Compact City”
  or “Urban Intensification” in the United Kingdom. These urban planning
  paradigms adhere to market and efficiency principles and are ecologically
  sustainable. The core idea hinges on a "triple bottom line accounting,"
  balancing human well-being, environmental sustainability, and commercial
  viability.
</p>

<p>
  However, resistance to urban density and compactness also has its advocates,
  the origins of which are complex. The anti-density narrative is sometimes
  tinged with elitism while also resonating with populist and anti-intellectual
  sentiments. Thus, the “Smart Growth” argument serves as a counter-narrative in
  this ideological struggle.
</p>

<p>
  This wraps up our exploration of the role of walking in cities, both past and
  present. While modes of transport have evolved, the basic principles of urban
  design around walking hold valuable lessons for modern-day planners and
  residents alike. The parameters may change, but the essence remains—a
  well-designed city must prioritize the feet that tread its streets.
