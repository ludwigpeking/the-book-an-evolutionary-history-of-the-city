<h1>32 the Language of Urban Design (1) Circle, Grid</h1>

<p>
  Cities began from spontaneous settlements, starting from vernacular
  architectural types. Their early development was very rustic and lacked
  theoretical underpinning, but it was orderly.
</p>

<p>
  This order stemmed from the internal dynamics of society and the mechanical
  structure between society and nature. Just as water molecules don't understand
  theory and have no aesthetic preferences, due to their specific shape and
  intermolecular forces, they can crystallize into beautifully shaped
  snowflakes.

<p>
  Similar crystallization phenomena exist in human settlements. Take, for
  instance, the circular fortresses common on flatlands. Since ancient times,
  tribes across the world have frequently adopted this shape. One of the main
  reasons people congregate is for efficient mutual defense.
</p>

<p>
  There's nothing mysterious about the circular shape of these fortresses. Given
  the same perimeter and defense structures like walls and ditches, it can
  enclose the largest possible area, accommodating the most people and
  resources.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, it's the most cost-effective shape for a fortress. Nomadic tribes
  in Africa, indigenous Americans, and ancient tribes in Europe and Asia all
  widely used this shape. Today, the circular defenses of the 13th-century
  German city of Nordlingen are still clearly visible.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, the circle is akin to a city's crystalline form like a snowflake. This
  shape arises from a singular mechanical structure focused on defense
  cost-efficiency. However, a circle lacks environmental sensitivity and
  generally suits smaller settlements. In a small settlement, resembling a
  point, its surrounding geographical environment is relatively consistent. For
  larger towns intersecting with trade routes, slopes, especially rivers, and
  other geographical features, retaining a simple circular shape may no longer
  retain its original defensive efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  Much like a snowflake retains its form in a pure environment and remains
  small, a larger block of ice subjected to complex external factors can't
  maintain a snowflake's shape.
</p>

<p>
  Yet, the circular shape, historically seen as representing cities, has
  embedded itself in human cognition, becoming a part of our understanding of
  cities.
</p>

<p>
  In later eras, some major cities also adopted this circular layout. For
  instance, Ecbatana in the ancient Medes kingdom around 700 BCE, Baghdad during
  the Abbasid dynasty in the 8th century, and Shenyang, the Manchu metropolis in
  the 17th century, all derived their circular plans largely from this concept.
</p>

<p>
  While these ancient cities' circular shapes might have still held some
  defensive value, in modern times without traditional defenses, some architects
  have explored the language of circular cities. Ebenezer Howard's envisioned
  Garden Cities of Tomorrow consisted of circular town combinations; Jacque
  Fresco's Venus Project in Florida was a conceptual circular city. More
  recently, the Apple headquarters in California, designed by Sir Norman Foster
  in 2017, adopted a massive circular form. Their ceremonial or futuristic
  nature often outweighs their practical efficiency, sometimes even seeming
  counterproductive.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, we view the circle as a language of urban design. Originating from
  spontaneous order, it has evolved into a body of knowledge or a concept.
  Sometimes, divorced from its original mechanical foundation, it continues to
  exert influence, occasionally manifesting in urban practices.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, many urban design languages arise from spontaneous order, captured
  by the human mind, entering the realm of ideas, seemingly taking on a life of
  their own. They become the primary language used in top-level designs,
  influencing the history and current reality of cities.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, they also participate in the evolution of cities, displaying
  varying degrees of vitality, representing new opportunities or threats for
  urban development. I will now discuss some phenomena related to this. Broadly
  speaking, I categorize the languages of urban design into four types:
</p>

<p>
  1) Grids;<br />2) Radial road networks;<br />3) Special patterns;<br />4)
  Freeform curves.
</p>

<p>
  I must note that Kostof also divided urban forms into four categories, which
  align closely with my classification. Let's discuss each one in detail.
</p>

<p><strong>1) Grids</strong></p>

<p>
  The grid system is undoubtedly the most important language in urban design,
  occupying a significant share of cities throughout history.
</p>

<p>
  Firstly, as I've mentioned previously, the square shape was often used in the
  design of the earliest huts. It evolved from practical applications,
  consolidating into a form due to its efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, ancient civilizations had limited knowledge in geometry and
  surveying. Without calculus, they couldn't efficiently calculate areas with
  curved shapes. Dividing land and streets into squares was thus a natural
  choice. Only elders or priests in ancient times had the mathematical and
  hydraulic knowledge to fairly and measurably allocate land. Thus, grid systems
  inherently implied top-down planning.
</p>

<p>
  Uniformly divided land corresponds to uniform fiscal, labor, or military
  obligations. Ancient Egyptian priests allocated land to farmers in this
  manner. This type of grid represented standardized taxation. When the Roman
  Republic allocated land to veterans, it was often divided in this grid-like
  manner. For them, this land was essentially their retirement plan. The US 1785
  Land Ordinance, which defined square mile sections, was a policy tool to
  privatize national land and set the basis for counties and townships. Hence,
  the grid system is a trace of administrative systems.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, standardized grids reduce costs associated with land surveying
  and research, thereby lowering transaction costs. This fosters land trading.
  New York once simulated vast land areas into 25x100 feet parcels. These were
  labeled and sold on maps. In reality, there might be no buildings or roads on
  the actual site â€“ just a featureless wilderness with a sign indicating where,
  for instance, 130th Street began. The parcel you intended to buy might have no
  markings. The transaction was often completed based on this imaginary grid
  system.
</p>

<p>
  Modern Chinese real estate also often uses standardized unit types for
  pre-sale properties to minimize differences, simplify customer decisions, and
  reduce time spent on comparisons.
</p>

<p>
  There are more advantages to grid cities. From a modern traffic engineering
  perspective, grid road networks simplify traffic calculations and make signal
  light control schemes easier to develop. However, this benefit is relatively
  minor.
</p>

<p>
  Importantly, most educated modern city dwellers are familiar with Cartesian
  coordinate systems. A grid road network, labeled with street numbers,
  essentially provides a city coordinate system. It greatly aids in navigation.
  In the US capital, Washington, D.C., the Capitol Building serves as the
  origin, dividing the city into four quadrants. Street addresses, like "205 F
  Street N.E.", can be interpreted as coordinates.

<p>
  Grids are enduring in urban design, emerging as high-quality knowledge within
  spontaneous orders. Yet, even if they're products of top-down planning, their
  inherent differences can be vast. For example, the large enclosed
  neighborhoods of Tang Dynasty Chang'an compared to the large blocks of Orange
  County, California, with side lengths between 800 to 900 meters. In contrast,
  Savannah, Georgia, has small grids about 25x50 meters. The scale of these
  grids can vary immensely even within the same century, as seen in the
  differences between Salt Lake City and Portland.
</p>

<p>
  While Portland might be closer to the mainstream size, Salt Lake City's grid
  is unusually large because its founders envisioned each household having a
  garden. This misinterprets urban lifestyles, as people typically focus on
  their primary professions rather than diversifying tasks like farming. Thus,
  Salt Lake City's grid is inefficient and calls for renovation.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, when Salt Lake City's large blocks are placed into contemporary
  Chinese urban planning, they seem small. I'll delve into the technical details
  another time, but those interested can refer to my earlier episodes, episodes
  28-30, discussing Portland and Salt Lake City.
</p>

<p>
  Even within the grid system, designs can differ vastly in intent, technical
  school, and resulting outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  In some contexts, grids incorporate mystical elements. For example, roads may
  be strictly aligned with the Earth's meridians to ensure true North-South
  orientation. What's the significance?
</p>

<p>
  Some believe that such houses are warmer in winter and cooler in summer. Real
  estate agents often emphasize whether a house faces true North or South.
</p>

<p>
  However, from an architectural thermodynamics standpoint, such precision is
  insignificant. Still, statistics show that a considerable proportion of grid
  road networks are oriented true North-South. There are generally two
  situations regarding its origin:
</p>

<p>
  Firstly, to locate the true meridian direction, neither a compass nor the
  North Star is entirely accurate. The Earth has a magnetic declination, and the
  position of the North Star drifts due to the precession of equinoxes. One must
  observe celestial phenomena to find the true north. In ancient times,
  observing the heavens was an advanced knowledge and a privilege. Among the
  tens of millions in the Han dynasty, only a handful of individuals truly
  observed these celestial events. How many people are genuinely observing the
  sky today?
</p>

<p>
  Thus, in the ancient world, being able to find the true north and employing it
  in urban planning, and further promoting this knowledge, at least symbolized
  the rulers' intellectual superiority over the ruled. The common people would
  be impressed, believing the leaders had a grasp on the mysterious forces of
  the universe.
</p>

<p>
  Humans fear uncertainty. To ease their minds, taboos were continually invented
  throughout history. Once you know where the north lies, a ruler might wonder,
  "What if the temple I worship in doesn't face true north? What if my head
  isn't directed towards the north? What if I incur divine punishment? But if I
  position myself with my head towards the true north and receive divine
  blessings, isnâ€™t that a gain?"
</p>

<p>
  The most notable example of the pursuit of the true north-south direction is
  the pyramids of Egypt, shrouded in mysterious tales. This is followed by
  ancient East Asian capitals, like Tang's Chang'an, which sought a north-south
  layout. Other examples include Kyoto in Japan, Yuan Dadu designed by Liu
  Bingzhong, and certain provincial capitals in northern China. All these
  places, to varying extents, pursued a north-south orientation. In reality,
  whether streets strictly align to the north-south axis isn't as crucial once
  this orientation becomes part of the narrative. For instance, Beijing's
  Chang'an Avenue isn't perfectly east-west. Maintaining a strict north-south
  alignment isn't easy. Some roads began with errors, and over time, as
  governance waned, some might encroach upon the road, leading to deviations.
</p>

<p>
  While the ancient world had many grid cities, a true north-south alignment
  wasn't predominant. However, in modern times, especially in North America, the
  proportion of cities with a true north-south grid is high. Examples include
  Washington D.C. and downtown Chicago. In other cities, particularly in the
  Midwest and the West, even if the city center doesn't strictly adhere to a
  north-south grid, the suburbs likely will. Detroit's downtown grid aligns with
  the river, while its suburbs follow a north-south direction. Minneapolis,
  Seattle, Los Angeles, and many other U.S. cities have a similar layout. This
  was a result of the Land Ordinance of 1791, under which professional teams
  divided the vast hinterland of America along longitudinal lines for
  calculation convenience.
</p>

<p>
  Surveyors truly expanded the frontiers. For instance, the boundary between New
  York, Vermont, and Canada was intended to follow the 45th parallel north.
  However, a story goes that a tipsy surveyor made an error, shifting the
  intended fortress site a few hundred meters into Canadian territory. As a
  result, the U.S. border expanded northward beyond the 45th parallel.
</p>

<p>
  Blindly drawing a north-south grid lacks environmental sensitivity. Most
  American city centers don't strictly follow a north-south grid, as urban
  geography â€“ like bridges, docks, and rivers â€“ must be considered.
</p>

<p>
  It's only in vast, unpopulated regions that surveyors can boldly draw lines,
  crossing streams, rocks, and frontiers without concern. However, North America
  wasn't truly uninhabited; it was home to Indigenous peoples. Their numbers
  were small, and they were overwhelmed by the settlers. Their nomadic
  lifestyles and lack of stable land ownership made their presence easily
  ignored, treating their lands as blank slates. Hence, the grid, especially the
  north-south grid, as an urban design language, reflects the authoritarian view
  of the cartographers over the depicted areas.
</p>

<p>
  Northern China couldn't possibly be considered uninhabited, right? The
  prevalence of the grid system similarly highlights the stark power imbalance
  between rulers and the ruled. This concludes this segment. In our next
  segment, I will continue to introduce other urban design languages.
</p>
