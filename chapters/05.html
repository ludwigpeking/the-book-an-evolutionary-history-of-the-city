  I disccussed in the previous issuethat the symbiotic relationship between
  hunters and farmers is the origin of ancient urban communities. Hunters
  constitute the warrior nobility, while farmers form the common people. Many
  heroes in national founding myths are shepherds, such as Israel's David, who
  was the shepherd who killed Goliath with a slingshot. The oldest human
  literature, the hero Enkidu in the Epic of Gilgamesh, is also portrayed as a
  shepherd. They first herded sheep, and after becoming monarchs, they were
  often referred to as "shepherds of the people."
</p>

<p>
  The audient "blossom in his heart" asked: For a nation, can barbarism overcome
  civilization? For each individual, can cruelty overcome gentleness? This seems
  to carry some undertones of the Dark Forest Law. If that's the case, wouldn't
  it be too gloomy?
</p>

<p>
  I will try to answer briefly: Barbarism overcoming civilization is a notion
  that exists, but it may be an excuse made by those who claim to be civilized
  for their failures. But in reality, who is barbaric and who is civilized is
  not easy to determine, so one should not fully believe such assertions.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout history, people have three types of interactions with history: one,
  those who wield the power and have larger influence to the course of history;
  two, those who are responsible to write and interpret history; and three,
  those who are mostly influenced by the history written by others.
</p>

<p></p>

<p>
  People who shape history, such as the Emperor Aguda of the Jin Dynasty, or the
  Dutch East India Company, are few in number, accounting for only 1/1000, but
  they create the main currents of history. However, they don't pay much
  attention to shaping historical records, nor do they create particularly
  complex theories for themselves, and, like some kings of the Carolingian
  Empire, they are not very literate. The phrase "not very literate" is in the
  Latin sense; Charlemagne, of course, was proficient in his own mother tongue,
  it's just that the writing system at the time hadn't yet been established.
</p>

<p>
  Those who write history are usually scholar-officials in China, or left-wing
  intellectuals in the West, with the former generally much more absurd than the
  latter. They are all particularly adept at compiling materials, but they don't
  really understand the actions of those who shape history because they have
  never stood in their shoes. On the contrary, they think their work is very
  important, as they are setting their hearts for the universe and their lives
  for the people. But in fact, the history they write often belittles the true
  creators of history, placing themselves on a particularly high pedestal.
</p>

<p>
  On the one hand, they mislead the general public, while on the other hand,
  they cultivate a new generation of scholar-officials and left-wing literati.
</p>

<p>
  The number of the general public is much larger, and the version they like or
  can read is what we usually know as history. In this kind of history, those
  who really create history are often portrayed as barbaric and backward.
</p>

<p>
  For example, many people have a stereotypical impression of the Jin Dynasty as
  nomadic shepherds wearing animal skin hats, but archaeological evidence shows
  that the Jin people's blast furnaces were very advanced. Other information
  beyond history will reveal the truth, such as the description of Jin soldiers
  in folklore stories - "iron butchers", which are entirely French heavy cavalry
  equipment. There are also stories like the "Mengchong warship" ridden by Jin
  Wushu. You can know that the Jin Dynasty was actually very developed in
  manufacturing and shipbuilding, even more developed than the Song Dynasty,
  although they couldn't surpass the Song people in writing lyrics.
</p>

<p>
  Gentleness does not necessarily lose to cruelty. Generally, being gentle is
  not a bad thing; but weakness and indifference are another matter. They
  essentially reflect people's constant desire to take advantage of loopholes
  and free rides, failing to take on the responsibility of maintaining social
  order, and letting it degenerate and become chaotic. Farmers often lose to
  hunters, and it's not just because of the lack of fighting power of farmers.
  In fact, there are tens or hundreds of times more farmers than hunters. If
  farmers can't beat hunters, it's because they lack organization and the will
  to protect their way of life. They may have been reduced to quasi-slaves
  without initiative in the previous society, and it doesn't matter who their
  master is. The fact is that farmers are not destined to be weak, and it's not
  that farmers are destined to be inferior to hunters. After all, farmers are
  the descendants of hunters, people are all similar, it's just the
  circumstances that are different. If farmers enter the frontier blue ocean,
  they can also become brave pioneers. Like Americans on the East Coast moving
  to the West, they become tough cowboys. Western Japanese farmers may become
  samurai lords when they get to the Kanto region. German farmers who went to
  the Eastern European plains to cultivate became Junker military aristocrats.
</p>

<p>
  Roman farmers fled to the sandbanks on the beach to take refuge, establishing
  the maritime nation of the Republic of Venice, which dominated the Eastern
  Mediterranean for four to five hundred years.

  The Roman farmers fled to the sandbars on the beach for refuge, establishing
  the maritime Republic of Venice, which dominated the Eastern Mediterranean for
  four to five hundred years.
</p>

<p>
  The lifestyles of farmers and hunters, from the perspective of evolution,
  represent two evolutionary strategies. One is short-term stability but
  long-term fragility, the other carries higher risk but also the potential for
  explosive growth. The combination of these two strategies forms the
  civilization discussed in this program, the social organization platform of
  cities. Their combination forms a division of labor that is not homogeneous,
  but hierarchical.
</p>

<p>
  In reality, the combination of hunters or nomadic tribes and agricultural
  tribes is rich in detail, and it is not necessarily simple, brutal, or
  one-sided.
</p>

<p>
  In the founding myth of Rome, their first leader, Romulus, was a shepherd.
  Moreover, it is said that he was an abandoned child, raised by a she-wolf, and
  that he grew up drinking wolf milk.
</p>

<p>
  Needless to say, you also know, it must have been that shepherd Romulus was
  particularly brave, he had a way with dealing with wolves, so he boasted that
  he grew up drinking wolf milk. Romulus, it is said, was driven out of his
  hometown of Alba by his fellow villagers. He probably was very tenacious, with
  the aura of a mafia boss, you can call him Brother Rom. He and his brother
  mixed with a bunch of bachelor shepherds, and became their leader. Later, they
  built a stronghold on the Palatine Hill by the Tiber River. The Palatine Hill,
  though called a hill, is just a small hill about 30-40 meters high, with a
  relatively flat top, covering an area of 400 by 300 meters, about a dozen
  hectares, any real estate project in China today is larger than this. The
  location of this hill was not chosen randomly, it is west of the Tiber River,
  and on its other three sides, there are wetlands and seasonal ravines between
  it and other hills. So it essentially has a natural moat, which you can't see
  today because the Romans later filled them up to build houses.
</p>

<p>
  Such a place was the greatest center of classical Mediterranean civilization.
  Its extraordinary development is of great interest. As for Romulus, as long as
  his remains were not found with his name or iconic objects, he remains a
  mythical figure. However, even myths are not made up arbitrarily. They must
  have a real background.
</p>

<p>
  Settling in a fortress, for a real shepherd, is not much of an advantage. If
  you want to have a lot of sheep, you need to find a broad valley and live a
  nomadic lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
  Although it's not clear in the historical stories, we can reasonably imagine
  that Romulus shepherd band was not purely herding. There were many settled
  agricultural tribes living around them. Including the Etruscans, Sabines,
  Samnites, and the Latins who spoke the same language as Romulus himself, etc.
  Romulus probably also managed land, hired tenant farmers, and provided them
  with protection. He might also have collected protection fees from nearby
  villages, or provided some judicial services. To provide judicial services,
  you need the ability to enforce judgements, so Romulus should be quite
  competent as a judge, at least for enforcement. In addition, they might also
  trade with the people around them, or serve as bodyguards, debt collectors,
  etc.
</p>

<p>
  In the founding myth of Rome, the first big thing Romulus did after founding
  the city was to snatch a bunch of girls from the neighboring Sabine village at
  a banquet to be their wives. According to current laws, he would be considered
  a full-fledged rapist.
</p>

<p>
  But in the story, this seems to be a great achievement. Then, the village of
  the kidnapped girls and the Romulus' stronghold had a so-called "war". By that
  time, the Italian region had already entered the Bronze Age, and both sides
  should have some very lethal weapons, but there seemed to be few casualties in
  the battle. In the end, the women could not be taken back, and the fact that
  everyone became relatives could not be changed. So, the people of the Sabine
  village simply moved to Quirinal Hill next to the Palatine Hill, where the
  Italian presidential palace is today, and the two tribes formed a stronghold
  city-state.
</p>

<p>
  Romulus' stronghold city-state, like Water Margin's Liangshan, welcomed anyone
  who came to join. After Romulus' death, the kingship was not passed to his
  son, or even to his shepherd folks. The newly established patricians elected a
  descendant of the Sabine people, who had their daughters kidnapped, Numa, as
  the new king. You can imagine him as Song Jiang being elected by everyone
  after Chao Gai's death. Numa, indeed, was like Song Jiang in the legend. Numa
  didn't like to fight, he was known for his wisdom and piety, a leader who was
  good at ideological management, teaching the Romans to respect the gods and
  lifes.
</p>

<p>
  We can see that the founding myth of Rome is very classic. The integration of
  hunters and farmers here is not as one-sided as one might think. Romulus
  represents the bravery of hunters, while Numa Pompilius, a Sabine, whose
  people had been settled and engaged in farming for a longer time, are closer
  to a farming tribe. They were not as strong as Romulus' band, and they were
  second in the formation of the symbiotic body, but they were not completely
  passive. The elites among them could at least compete for the position of the
  priest and ideological managers of the sacred land. The process of Rome's
  founding myth is a process of alternating leadership between the religious and
  military powers.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, farmers in the symbiotic body are not necessarily passive. They
  have a great chance to attain the position of priests. The Germanic barbarians
  ruled the Latin people, but the Latin people infused Christianity into the
  Germanic people and spread it to the north of Europe.
</p>

<p>
  (* This paragraph talks about "Water Margin", also known as "Outlaws of the
  Marsh". The novel has Chao Gai and Song Jiang as the martial founding leader
  and the intelligent successive leader respectively.)
</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>
  After hunters and farmers form a symbiotic body, they may merge, or even
  completely assimilate.
</p>

<p>
  Hunters were originally protectors and active maintainers of the symbiotic
  body. Their image is both frightening and respectable. However, if they are
  assimilated by farmers, they may lose their warrior traits, becoming hollow
  nobility, appearing redundant and detestable. This signifies the degeneration
  of the urban community and is also the reason why traditional urban
  communities lose stability and move towards destruction. This process of
  martial virtue degeneration is particularly fast on the North China Plain,
  from Dorgon to Qianlong, it only takes about 100 years, three to four
  generations. To reach exhaustion and extinction, it can hold out for another
  hundred years. It is also extremely rapid in the fertile plains of Mesopotamia
  and the Nile. From the time Cyrus II occupied Babylon to the cultural
  prosperity of the Artaxerxes era, it is 100 years. Then to the extinction of
  Darius III, it is another 100 years.
</p>

<p>
  In the hilly areas, where farming and herding are mixed, and the elements of
  commerce and the sea are richer, it seems to be slower. For instance, the case
  of Rome, from its founding in the 8th century BC, to the Roman Empire period,
  when fighting was mainly dependent on barbarian generals, it took seven to
  eight hundred years. Or in the Isle of France, from the time the Capetian
  knights took the throne, to the Louis XVI era, when the king and nobles were
  abandoned by the citizens, it was also about 800 years.
</p>

<p>
  The order vacuum caused by the loss of warriors will be filled by others. One
  of the candidates is monks, or priests. In troubled times, monks often arm
  themselves to maintain order, similar to the historical background of the
  Shaolin Temple on Mount Song.
</p>

<p>
  If the monk group is especially successful, they may even seize its world.
</p>

<p>
  That's the case with Egypt's 21st Dynasty, the citeis they left behind are
  mostly huge temples, Luxor and Karnak;
</p>

<p>
  Japan's so-called Sengoku daimyō, in essence, were armed landlords. In places
  closer to the capital, where the landlord's armed forces are relatively weak.
  The influence of temples has surpassed that of the landlord militias, and even
  that of the court. A large number of people depended on monasteries, even to
  the point of forming monastery cities. Japan's big city, Osaka, was originally
  built by the warrior monk group, Ishiyama Hongan-ji.
</p>

<p>
  In Europe, we often see monasteries that are exactly like castles. They also
  count as traces of the survival of temple congregations in troubled times.
</p>

<p>
  We know that Zhu Yuanzhang developed from the rebel army of the Ming Sect
  (Manichaeism). However, after Zhu Yuanzhang seized the world, he actually
  suppressed the Ming Sect. If he hadn't done this, today there might still be
  many land temples worshipping Maitreya Buddha, Mazda altars look like the
  Temple of Heaven, or Confucius or Zhang Tianshi statues being called the Left
  Envoy of Light. (*joke from the novel The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber by Jin
  Yong)
</p>

<p>
  In addition to this, the underworld and grassroots police officers may also
  fill the vacuum and become rulers. Heroes like Liu Bang, Li Zicheng, and Cheng
  Yaojin emerged.
</p>

<p>
  More directly, it is the armed colonists from outside. You can call them
  conquerors, or barbarian immigrants. Whether called Libyans, Nubians, Hyksoss,
  Dorians, Aryans, Huns, Goths, Franks, Lombards, Normans, Russ, Xianbeis,
  Magyars Humans, Ottomans, Mughals, Jurchens, or something like that could be
  hundreds of, recurring patterns.
</p>

<p>
  Once the new hunters become the rulers, the next cycle of assimilation with
  the peasants begins.
</p>

<p>
  The above are some supplements to the symbiotic interaction between hunters
  and farmers.
</p>
