<h1>
  23 Suburbanization - Second Half - the Socio-Economy in Automobile Suburbs
</h1>

<p>
  In my previous analysis, I discussed the American-style car-centric suburbs.
  The materials and perspectives I used, aside from some personal insights,
  largely align with the consensus within the American urban planning education
  system, often referred to as the knowledge base of the political left. They
  tend to view car-centric suburbs as a societal problem, or even a severe one.
  Since I also come from this educational background, I have been systematically
  trained to think within this framework. Therefore, I rarely challenge this
  perspective.
</p>

<p>
  However, I am aware that most people, not just in China but also a significant
  portion of Americans, especially the general population, find it hard to
  comprehend and resonate with this viewpoint. Many Americans would ask, "Why do
  we love our suburban homes and gardens so much while you seem to dislike
  them?" In China, for instance, when I was younger, I heard adults discussing
  American suburban homes with an air of envy.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, even among American "white left" intellectuals, many live in
  suburban homes with gardens and drive two SUVs. Only a minority genuinely
  embrace an urban lifestyle. So, I also have an inkling that the mainstream
  critique of car-centric suburbs, while containing profound elements, may also
  carry a bit of affluent people's complaints.
</p>

<p>
  Hence, if we aim to pursue a higher level of truth and possess a more
  interdisciplinary approach, I must provide some counter-perspectives.
</p>

<p>
  My core point in this perspective is, regardless of how you look at it,
  American-style suburbanization is primarily a result of market forces. What
  you see is the outcome of market choices, shaped by people using their
  hard-earned money and voting with their feet. So, even if there are flaws, how
  far-fetched can they be?
</p>

<p>
  Let's explain some phenomena of American car-centric suburbs from a market
  perspective:
</p>

<p><strong>1) Why don't they build high-rises in these suburbs?</strong></p>

<p>
  Because there's no cost advantage to doing so. Initially, the land was cheap.
  In the United States, in many cases, concrete houses are more expensive than
  wooden ones. So, high-rises not only aren't easy to sell, but they also aren't
  more profitable. In fact, in some places, high-rises have emerged as a result
  of rising land prices. However, land prices are only sensitive in a few
  locations. In the backdrop of large, low-density residential areas, high-rises
  appear, like nuclei forming in invisible water vapor, creating clouds. This is
  an expression of an evolving order.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >2) Why don't they build some stores and other amenities in low-density
    residential areas?</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Because in places with low population density, stores don't make money, so no
  one invests in them. Schools and churches are exceptions.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >3) Why are the building types often so uniform in low-density residential
    areas?</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Because this homogeneity, which leads to class segregation, is what homebuyers
  want. One significant reason American suburbanization is so pronounced is due
  to the civil rights movement and racial conflicts. A primary motivation for
  white Americans moving to the suburbs was to escape to areas with relatively
  homogenous populations. Additionally, communities and school districts are
  closely linked. In purely middle-class neighborhoods, there is greater
  consistency in student behavior, enabling the isolation of non-mainstream
  youth. This is what parents desire. Class segregation is a critical, albeit
  hidden, selling point of real estate products. It helps maintain stable
  housing prices. If developers create a broad range of housing options that
  lead to class mixing, it might affect sales. The mosaic-like spatial
  structure, mixing high-density with low-density and different class levels, is
  a general feature of human societal spatial distribution, a result of the dual
  external conditions of security and efficiency. It's not easily eradicated by
  the simple notion of equality.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >4) Why do some communities have policies that prohibit mixed-use housing
    and only allow single-family homes?</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  If the previous phenomena were market-driven, these community policies are
  clearly anti-market.
</p>

<p>
  However, anti-market policies should not be seen as necessarily arbitrary. We
  can't be overly dogmatic, thinking that everything market-driven is good. For
  example, you can't sell nuclear bombs to enemies, no matter how much they're
  willing to pay. We must understand that these policies aren't nationwide
  regulations, not even at the state or county level. They are specific to each
  community or municipality and reflect local sentiment. Communities themselves
  must understand that if investors believe their policies are unfavorable, they
  won't invest there. This is the litmus test for policies. A community that
  consistently adopts less inclusive policies may deter outside investment, but
  it at least indicates that residents believe these policies benefit them. You
  can't guarantee that less inclusive public sentiment is necessarily misguided
  or populist. The existence of a wide variety of local land policies, whether
  they are blind to certain factors or not, is an expression of the level of
  community organization and self-governance ability. They constitute a policy
  market characterized by diverse choicesâ€”a policy ecosystem conducive to
  evolution.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >5) Why are most suburban plots single-use, either all residential, all
    office parks, or all commercial?</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Single-use residential areas are maintained to keep the population structure
  homogeneous. Entirely office or commercial areas are created to achieve
  economies of scale with sufficient network effects.
</p>

<p>
  Industries in the same sector need to be concentrated, facilitating
  communication and logistics. This is the rationale behind industrial parks.
  The same applies to commerce; businesses can bring traffic to one another and
  share resources like parking spaces. One consumer driving to shop at two
  separate stores, if they were not located together, would require two parking
  spaces. Combining them into one space saves resources.
</p>

<p>
  We generally believe that mixed-use areas improve utilization efficiency, but
  this is conditional. In car-centric suburbs, where there are ample parking
  lots, the floor area ratio (FAR) is usually low, often below 0.5. In such
  low-density areas, combining low-density industrial parks and low-density
  commercial zones may not necessarily increase efficiency. It might dilute each
  other's efficiency during the interweaving process.
</p>

<p>
  So, single-use, low-density industrial parks and commercial zones are, in
  fact, cost and efficiency-driven.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >6) Why is land development often sporadic with gaps rather than
    continuous?</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  This is because cars are not sensitive to small distances; a kilometer more or
  less doesn't make much difference. The land's value is relatively homogeneous,
  but the costs of municipal connections and clearing can vary widely. The
  fluctuation in land costs is more sensitive. These lands are held by different
  owners, regardless of the diverse real-world situations. The landowners' game
  is whether to develop and cash in first or wait for neighbors to develop and
  drive up land prices before cashing in. This reflects different judgments
  about land value trends. Land with proactive development and lower bidding
  prices is prioritized for development.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >7) Does the United States have any policies that encourage car-centric
    suburbs?</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  Yes, the most significant one was the interstate highway system subsidized by
  the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s. This undoubtedly reinforced the
  dominance of cars and made suburban development more convenient. While this
  money came from the entire nation, suburban residents benefited the most.
  However, these highways also serve as the arteries of regional logistics,
  ultimately greatly enhancing national production efficiency. There are no
  losers in this situation. You can't imagine not building these highways today.
</p>

<p><strong>8) Is car-centric suburban living sustainable?</strong></p>

<p>
  If the entire world were to live like Americans, there wouldn't be enough
  space or oil. However, we can already see that technologies for transitioning
  to renewable energy sources are gradually maturing. Additionally, autonomous
  driving technology could improve road efficiency. Vehicle sharing can reduce
  resource consumption and alleviate parking pressure. Currently, there are 300
  million Americans with over 200 million cars, roughly one car per person, even
  accounting for children. In the future, 1.4 billion Indians might achieve a
  similar standard of living with only 200 million cars, mainly electric ones
  powered by renewable energy and used for sharing. So, I believe that as
  technology advances, the car-centric lifestyle still has a chance to continue
  and even spread to more of the world's population.
</p>

<p>Let me summarize the points I've made above:</p>

<p>
  The American suburban ideal is rooted in a natural yearning for rural living.
  It's remarkably straightforward, lacking any grand planning. At its core, it's
  market-driven, prioritizing cost-efficiency. The class division resulting from
  suburbanization has both positive and negative aspects, reflecting the choices
  of a segment of consumers.
</p>

<p>
  This phenomenon coincided with a period of rapid economic growth. The
  post-World War II era witnessed the widespread adoption of automobiles and the
  construction of extensive highway networks. This was driven, in part, by the
  pressures of racial conflict and created a tremendous demand for suburban
  housing. This model rapidly replicated and expanded across the nation,
  claiming vast swaths of land. It gave rise to the seemingly endless uniformity
  of low-density sprawl, fostering a lifestyle that is expensive, reliant on
  fossil fuels, and centered around the automobile. While this can be considered
  a societal issue, it's important to understand that expecting a society
  without problems is an idealistic notion. Societies inherently generate
  problems, and the societal issues brought about by automobiles may not be
  significant in the grand scope of human history or future.
</p>

<p>
  Above and beyond the automobile suburbs, we can anticipate a differentiation
  in density and building types, leading to the emergence of more intricate
  social structures. This promises to be a stage for innovative architectural
  developments.
