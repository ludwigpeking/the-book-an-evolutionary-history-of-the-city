<p><strong>Efficiency: Domestic and Urban</strong></p>

<p>
  Before diving into the intricacies of street design, let's examine the spatial
  organization within our homes and offices. Typically, the master bedroom is
  closer to the bathroom, while the secondary bedroom is farther away.
  Similarly, conference rooms are usually situated near the offices of company
  leaders—a few meters can make all the difference, revealing a hierarchy of
  privileges.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine asking your spouse or boyfriend to walk a few meters to turn off the
  light or fetch a remote control. These small conveniences are, in themselves,
  a form of cherished privilege. The allure of an efficient layout design in a
  home comes from having multiple access points—for instance, a bedroom door
  opening to the living room, another to the study, and another to a balcony.
  Such interconnected design provides various shortcuts, making navigation
  between rooms much more convenient.
</p>

<p>
  However, a domestic space can’t be all corridors; otherwise, there'd be no
  room for furniture or living. These passageways, too, occupy space. Designers
  meticulously consider every meter and centimeter when planning a layout, an
  attention to detail that should be equally applied in urban planning. In an
  efficiency-driven city, a web of interconnected streets and shortcuts not only
  saves time but also adds to the overall functionality. The principles at play
  are consistent between domestic layouts and city infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  As ordinary citizens, we often find ourselves wanting to go to Point A, which
  is visible right in front of us, yet have to circle around a barrier or fence,
  sometimes walking hundreds of extra meters. Take, for instance, crossing from
  the east gate to the west gate of Chaoyang Park. If the park is open, the
  direct walk is only about 1 kilometer. But if the park is closed, walking
  around its perimeter takes about 3 kilometers—an additional 2 kilometers
  simply because one direct route is unavailable. The convenience enjoyed at
  home a hundred times over may not necessarily offset this inconvenience.
  Therefore, having a web of streets within a not-so-large fenced area ensures
  we don’t have to take circuitous routes.
</p>

<p>
  However, there's a trade-off: more streets and shortcuts consume land,
  diluting the urban density and potentially lowering efficiency. We must
  balance the convenience of interconnected pathways with the need to maintain a
  compact, functional urban environment.
</p>

<p>Street systems in pedestrian-dominated environments</p>

<p><strong>Informal Occupation</strong></p>

<p>
  In spontaneous settings, many individuals may seek to encroach upon public
  roads. If such occupation does not interfere with the public function of these
  spaces, it is generally tolerated and not dismantled. Alternatively, a lack of
  organized public resistance may allow such occupation to persist unchecked.
</p>

<p>
  However, excessive road occupation is usually curbed—the saying goes that
  "even a good dog doesn't stand in the way."
</p>

<p><strong>Equilibrium</strong></p>

<p>
  The need for a dense network of easily accessible roads is in tension with the
  desire to repurpose road space for other uses. These opposing forces are
  continually at play.
</p>

<p>
  A street holds its value based on its width and its convenience for both
  pedestrian and vehicular movement, often outweighing its value as potential
  building land.
</p>

<p>
  The equilibrium—or the state of optimal efficiency—between these conflicting
  needs often takes years to evolve.
</p>

<p>
  The configuration of cities we observe today is the result of such evolution,
  and different cities exhibit different equilibrium states:
</p>

<p>
  For instance, the labyrinthine streets of ancient Italian cities like Bologna
  and Florence are more interconnected than those in ancient Egyptian and Indian
  cities like Cairo and Ahmedabad, where dead-ends are far more common.
</p>

<p>
  This is likely influenced by each community's approach to public management
  and could also be related to historical events like disasters or population
  fluctuations.
</p>

<p>
  In some cities, the ruling authority commands such respect that no one dares
  to encroach upon the roads the ruler frequently uses. However, other roads may
  fall into neglect and become blocked, effectively turning into dead-ends.
</p>

<p>
  Or perhaps, the city underwent a crisis that led to depopulation and decay,
  turning once well-maintained infrastructures, including roads, into ownerless
  assets subject to random occupation. As a result, previously functional road
  systems may become fragmented, turning into dead-end alleys.
</p>

<p>
  From a topological perspective, traversable roads and dead-ends represent two
  distinct types of pathways.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, external changes, such as technological advancements, can also shift
  this equilibrium state.
</p>

<p>
  Demand for a dense network of easily accessible roads conflicts with the
  desire to use road space for other purposes. The equilibrium—or optimal
  efficiency—between these competing needs is a result of years of evolution.
</p>

<p>
  What we see in the state of cities today is the outcome of this evolution.
</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchy</strong></p>

<p>
  Stop for a moment and imagine what such a system would ultimately evolve into?
</p>

<p>
  What usually emerges is a hierarchical system: major roads are few but carry
  the most traffic; smaller roads are numerous but don't experience as much
  traffic.
</p>

<p>
  However, let's reverse the usual approach and start from the smallest roads.
</p>

<p><strong>The Minimal</strong></p>

<p>
  The minimal width of a road is vital as it represents the most efficient use
  of space:
</p>

<p>
  The shoulder width of an average adult ranges between 40-50 cm. When walking,
  a width of 80-90 cm is generally comfortable. This is sufficient for two
  people walking in opposite directions to pass each other rather tightly. The
  minimum effective width of a street is, therefore, around 80-90 cm. Such
  narrow alleys are common in Medieval Europe, Mumbai's slums, old Beijing, and
  commercial districts in Tokyo's Kichijoji. In fact, this width is often seen
  within our homes for doors and passageways. Such narrow roads certainly save a
  lot of space. In cities like Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India, or Cairo, Egypt,
  where the sun is intense and there's no need for freight traffic in
  residential areas, many streets are indeed this narrow.
</p>

<p>However, such lanes are not without their shortcomings.</p>

<p>
  When walking in the streets, we often do so with friends and family. Social
  interactions require more space. Such narrow roads can't accommodate wagons or
  make it easy to move goods. They're also inconvenient for construction work.
  Furthermore, houses without courtyards depend on windows facing the street for
  natural light, which isn't effective if the street is too narrow. So, while
  streets narrower than 1 meter are common, they aren't the dominant types of
  roads in cities.
</p>

<p><strong>The Intermediate</strong></p>

<p>
  Good commercial streets should allow two pairs of pedestrians walking shoulder
  to shoulder to pass each other, with some room to spare. Also, shops need to
  accommodate customers coming in and out. This requires a width of at least 3
  meters.
</p>

<p>
  In Beijing, this would be a medium-small alley; in Shanghai, it would be one
  of the narrower lanes in a Shikumen complex.
</p>

<p>
  Streets 3-4 meters wide are not as narrow as some professionals might imagine.
  They can accommodate horse-drawn carriages or pushcarts.
</p>

<p>
  In terms of its effective width for the passage of pedestrians, it greatly
  surpasses that of the gateways at modern metro stations. Such streets can
  accommodate peak flows of several thousand to tens of thousands of people per
  hour, and tens of thousands of people daily. This is the width of the main
  commercial street in Venice, Merceria Orologio, as well as the corridors of
  Istanbul's Grand Bazaar and the typical indoor pathways in modern shopping
  malls.
</p>

<p>
  However, 3-4 meter wide pedestrian streets have one issue: if a few people
  stand still in the middle of the road to discuss something—say, whether to go
  north for a meat sandwich or south for noodles—they can obstruct the flow of
  pedestrian traffic. This kind of standing around isn't very polite.
</p>

<p>
  Conversely, people tend not to loiter on such roads to avoid blocking the way.
  Even beggars prefer not to be there. Panhandlers also try to avoid obstructing
  the path as it tends to invite public resentment, which could affect their
  panhandling effectiveness. So, while these 3-4 meter streets can handle
  pedestrian traffic well, they're not conducive to social interaction or
  commercial activities. Nor can they accommodate large vehicles passing each
  other, making them less than ideal for frequent freight traffic.
</p>

<p><strong>The Grand</strong></p>

<p>
  To address issues of crowding and transport, cities often have wider streets,
  especially in vital commercial zones where the main pedestrian pathways should
  exceed 5 meters in width.
</p>

<p>
  Once a walkway reaches 5 meters in width, it can accommodate a massive
  pedestrian flow. The saturation capacity of a 5-meter wide pedestrian path is
  roughly 20,000 people per hour. This means that the number of pedestrians
  passing through a 5-meter wide pathway in an hour exceeds the number of cars
  that would pass through a 35-meter wide, 10-lane road in the same time frame.
</p>

<p>
  In general, pedestrian pathways don't see such enormous numbers. Hence, these
  wide pathways can also accommodate social and commercial activities. Stalls
  can be set up, and businesses can occupy portions of the street for temporary
  operations, like setting up tables for outdoor dining. This leads to a more
  multi-functional street.
</p>

<p>
  A 5-meter wide sidewalk is the width you'll find on New York's Fifth Avenue or
  in the pleasant downtown area of Portland. Students can gather around a
  professor at the side of the road for a lesson without causing any
  obstructions.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond this width, the benefits of added width become marginal. In less
  populated areas, this width might even be excessive. Generally, sidewalks
  wider than 5 meters are unnecessary. Of course, some cities, like Moscow, are
  deliberately widening sidewalks beyond 5 meters to create a sense of grandeur.
</p>

<p><strong>Mixed Street</strong></p>

<p>
  The above discussion focuses on sidewalks, but in main roads with lots of
  vehicular traffic, there must be separate lanes for different types of
  vehicles, distinct from pedestrian pathways. At intersections or crosswalks,
  people and vehicles will intersect. Sometimes crossing the street feels like a
  bothersome, stressful, and dangerous activity. A fundamental reason for this
  feeling is that the lanes for motorized vehicles are too wide.
</p>

<p>
  From a pedestrian's perspective, crossing is not very difficult on roads with
  four or fewer lanes. Roads with more than four lanes make it challenging for
  pedestrians to cross safely and conveniently.
</p>

<p>
  Developed countries are now focusing on enhancing the walking environment by
  narrowing the width of lanes for motorized vehicles to less than 10 meters, to
  give a feeling of leisurely walking. Lanes wider than 15 meters are to be
  avoided. However, such wide lanes—even those as wide as 30 meters—are
  frequently encountered in real life (in China), reflecting a lag in the road
  design industry's understanding.
</p>

<p>
  In traditional cities, the experience of walking is often free and relaxed;
  you traverse numerous neighborhoods with limited interference from motor
  vehicles. For example, in a typical Italian city like Ravenna, most buildings
  are about four stories high, and the streets are narrow, restricting the speed
  of cars. The roadways are so slim that they are easily crossed on foot. There
  are no large, enclosing walls—only individual courtyards for each household.
  The road network is intricate, with diagonally positioned streets ensuring
  that you never have to go out of your way to reach your destination. This is
  an environment sculpted by the dominant mode of pedestrian transport over a
  long history.
</p>

<p>
  Considering a walking distance of 500 meters, there could be thousands of
  people within this radius, capable of supporting more than just a single
  convenience store. On streets with high foot traffic, restaurants, cafes,
  bars, tobacco shops, grocery stores, laundromats, and even furniture and
  clothing stores can form dense, bustling corners. These areas offer a variety
  of activities, epitomizing the concept of a 'Main Street.'
</p>

<p>
  Away from the Main Street, on quieter roads, you'll find smaller corners with
  cafes, bars, and grocery shops all in one, serving a much smaller radius of
  perhaps only 50 meters. These small shops, ranging from a few tens to a couple
  of hundred square meters in size, often serve a relatively stable customer
  base, possibly over multiple generations. This is the condition of most
  traditional cities worldwide, be it in Ravenna, Munich, or Tokyo's Shinjuku
  Kabukicho district. Even modern metropolises like Chicago and New York offer a
  comfortable walking experience. This was one of my deepest impressions when I
  first stepped out to explore traditional cities around the world.
</p>

<p>
  In China, such traditional walkable areas are not lacking either. The ancient
  town of Lijiang and Shanghai's old French Concession are also very
  pedestrian-friendly.
</p>

<p>
  These areas nurture a lifestyle that doesn't depend on cars—environmentally
  friendly and cost-effective, offering people a valuable choice. This is the
  wealth bestowed upon them by the tradition of urban walking.
</p>

<p>
  To preserve this wealth, it's essential to recognize and appreciate the vital
  knowledge it encapsulates—a type of wisdom that is universally admired yet
  astonishingly forgotten in some places.
