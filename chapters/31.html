<h1>31 Mechanics: Thermal Map</h1>

<p>
  In this installment, I'll introduce a method of analysis, which serves as a
  supplement to the previous discussions on the dynamics of urban evolution.
  Let's briefly review what was discussed before. In the 13th lecture of this
  series, I compared the flow of resources and technology to electrical
  potential differences and transportation factors to conductors. Potential
  difference arises when one region possesses resources and technology while
  another lacks them, leading to a need for exchange. Realizing this exchange
  creates value. It's important to note that this potential difference is not
  due to distance but rather heterogeneity. For instance, Papua New Guinea and
  Congo are 13,000 kilometers apart with little need for exchange, while
  Tsinghua University and Wudaokou, only a few hundred meters apart, have
  intense exchange needs.
</p>

<p>
  Within human populations, there is inherent division of labor, leading to
  heterogeneity. Resources and technology are, to a significant extent, people
  themselves. Cities can generate substantial potential differences simply
  through the internal division of labor among its residents. In large cities,
  people frequently change where they dine—Italian today, Thai tomorrow. In
  villages, however, most meals are home-cooked. In the city, a person might
  ride in a car driven by a stranger, send dozens of emails, collaborate with
  hundreds, and patronize various venues for shopping and entertainment. In a
  village, daily entertainment might consistently be a game of mahjong with the
  same group of people. Human settlements adhere to the network effect: the more
  users, the greater the value. The potential difference created within a large
  city far surpasses that in a village. Greater potential difference and lower
  resistance mean a stronger flow of resources and technology, leading to
  greater wealth and complexity.
</p>

<p>
  More complex orders lead to finer divisions of labor and greater potential
  differences. To establish a particular division of labor, a certain scale is
  required. Only at this scale can enough momentum be generated for the
  emergence of specific industries and order. This principle is similar to the
  critical mass needed for a nuclear explosion. Every American city has
  hairdressers, but not necessarily Japanese cuisine. Both are relatively
  general industries.
</p>

<p>
  Certain specialized industries require accumulation at specific levels, and
  it's not just about comparing populations. Frankfurt is much smaller than New
  Delhi, but its financial sector is much more robust. Hengdian is tinier than
  Lagos, but its film and television industry is much stronger. Princeton is
  much smaller than Buenos Aires, but its scientific output is significantly
  greater. Such flows within cities are short-ranged and multi-leveled.
</p>

<p>
  In this lecture, I'll introduce another analogy used in urban research: the
  "thermal map." If you were to view someone with an infrared thermal imager,
  warmer areas would appear redder, while cooler areas would be greener. This is
  a thermal map. Urban researchers use similar tools, often mapping populations
  or specific geographic information. Red or certain markers indicate the "heat"
  or activity in urban areas. It's an intuitive method to observe structures.
  For instance, on public review platforms or property rental sites, map
  searches allow you to clearly sense the density of specific restaurants or
  properties in various districts, effectively presenting a "thermal map" of a
  particular aspect of a city.
</p>

<p>I'll introduce several general patterns:</p>

<p>
  <strong>1)</strong> <strong>Inner Heat, Outer Cool</strong>: Every individual
  is warm inside and cool on the outside. Internally, adjacent particles or
  elements all generate heat. However, the skin or outer layer, which is exposed
  and has only one side neighboring the heat source, tends to cool down more
  rapidly. Cities follow a similar principle. Take New York's Manhattan for
  example: the borough is bounded by rivers on its east and west sides, and as
  you traverse from east to west, you cross avenues sequentially from First to
  Ninth. The First and Ninth Avenues are riverfronts, and while they offer
  beautiful views and certain areas, like near the western side of the World
  Financial Center (WFC), have been meticulously developed, none of these
  riverfront avenues is a major commercial hub. The bustling heart of Manhattan
  lies along the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Avenues – all situated centrally on
  the island.
</p>

<p>
  The dynamics of urban activity demonstrate the 'Matthew effect' – areas with
  high activity or 'heat' tend to attract even more resources. As a result,
  central areas naturally have an advantage over the peripheries, an advantage
  that compounds over time. Hot areas get hotter, while cooler areas struggle to
  catch up.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>2) Boundary Vacuum</strong>: This concept, introduced by Jane Jacobs
  six decades ago, suggests that it's challenging to conduct commercial
  activities on the edges of spaces like parks or along riverbanks. The wider
  the river, the broader the road, or the larger the park, the harder it gets.
  Numerous attempts have been made to establish commercial streets along
  riverbanks, but most have not been very successful. For instance, while New
  York's Central Park is quite lively, the streets directly adjacent to it
  haven't developed into commercial zones. Fifth Avenue, which bustles with
  activity to the south, becomes subdued as it approaches the park,
  transitioning to a more residential ambiance. Main commercial districts in
  major world cities are typically not riverfronts. Overcoming the boundary
  vacuum to create bustling areas is a daunting task, with exceptions seen in
  places with traditional docks. Docks, being interfaces between water and city,
  attract resources and human traffic. Examples include Shanghai and Savannah.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>3) "Armpit Effect"</strong>: Observing the human body's surface
  temperature, you'll notice the armpits are warmer. This is because they are
  enclosed by the surrounding body, making them warmer than most external parts.
  Even though they are on the outside, they are surrounded by heat-generating
  points.
</p>

<p>
  Drawing parallels in urban contexts, areas bordering internal and external
  spaces, due to their unique position, can become potential hubs of activity.
  The southeast and southwest corners of New York's Central Park serve as prime
  examples. Both points, with three sides surrounded by the city and one by the
  park, resemble the form of an armpit. Many people enter and exit the park
  through these locations, making them vital hubs of activity.
</p>

<p>
  Locations resembling the "armpit" shape and situated next to water bodies are
  typically ideal spots for port cities, as they can draw from or radiate to
  vast land areas. The largest port city in the classical world, Corinth, was
  situated in such a semi-enclosed bay. Cities like Chicago, Genoa, Venice,
  Yingkou, and Trabzon in Turkey also occupy such 'armpit' positions. These
  locations witness a convergence of land-based traffic, akin to the
  concentration of major arteries and nerves in the human armpit region.
</p>

<p>
  4) <strong>Squeezing Effect</strong>. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the
  Inner City of Beijing had a massive block known as the Imperial City in the
  middle, which was impassable. From north to south, from Shichahai to the
  Southern Lake, there was an expansive ancient riverbed with limited bridges
  crossing it. Traffic from the north to the west largely squeezed through
  Yinding Bridge and Yandai Xiejie, forming bustling commercial streets. This
  bridge was also an essential route for the Regent Prince in the late Qing
  Dynasty, making it a frequent target for assassination attempts. This
  squeezing effect is common on bridges.
</p>

<p>
  Near Beijing University, Tsinghua University, the Summer Palace, and the Old
  Summer Palace are massive enclosed blocks. This configuration has resulted in
  north-south traffic getting compressed between Zhongguancun North Street and
  Yuanmingyuan West Road, forming two roads with significant traffic.
</p>

<p>
  In London's West End, traffic between Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace is also
  squeezed onto Knightsbridge Street. However, as previously mentioned, there's
  a boundary vacuum effect at the edge of large parks. Hence, commercial
  districts don't develop directly in these tight spots. Instead, they form on
  streets where the squeezing effect drives traffic into denser urban areas. For
  example, on Brompton Street, we find Harrods, the world's largest department
  store, and a bustling shopping district.
</p>

<p>
  Traffic compression also occurs at city gates, station entrances, residential
  community entrances, school gates, and more.
</p>

<p>
  5) <strong>Nucleation Effect</strong>. Pure supersaturated steam won't
  condense on its own. It requires other particles with higher electronegativity
  to promote condensation. Similarly, homogeneous backgrounds like a vast
  Midwestern grid in the U.S., which is an extremely uniform structure, need
  some variations for cities to nucleate and grow. These variations might be the
  confluence of two rivers or a bridge over a river. New York's grid system is
  very uniform, but Broadway's diagonal crossing increases local road density,
  making these areas more conducive to the development of commercial districts.
</p>

<p>
  6) <strong>Environmental Induction Effect</strong>. On a colder day, when two
  people sit side by side, they can feel the side facing each other is warmer.
  Similarly, the warmth or conditions of the surrounding environment can
  influence a city's internal dynamics. The southern commercial area of Beijing
  during the Ming and Qing Dynasties was more significant than the north due to
  the more considerable population in the hinterland of the North China Plain.
  Similarly, the eastern commercial area of Xi'an was more significant than the
  west due to the larger population coming from the vast Guandong region.
</p>

<p>
  A city isn't isolated in a vacuum; its external "thermal" environment also
  determines its internal thermodynamic distribution. Jersey City in New Jersey,
  although separated by a river from Manhattan, also has its own downtown area
  at Journal Square. However, its upscale residential and business districts
  have developed along the river facing Manhattan. The convenience of accessing
  Manhattan is a crucial factor in determining property value.
</p>

<p>
  In conclusion, this analysis using heat maps provides a dynamic method for
  understanding urban thermodynamics and how cities evolve and interact with
  their surroundings.
